Introducing Building Industrial Digital Twins: Design, develop, and deploy digital twin solutions for real-world industries using Azure Digital Twins by Pieter van Schalkwyk and Shyam Varan Nath 
Dallas, TX, November 2, 2021 – Digital twin technology enables organizations to create digital representations of physical entities such as assets, systems, and processes throughout their life cycle. It improves asset performance, utilization, and safe operations and reduces manufacturing, operational, and maintenance costs. 
 In Building Industrial Digital Twins, industry veterans Pieter van Schalkwyk and Shyam Varan Nath, introduce readers to the concept of digital twins and set them on a path to develop a digital twin strategy to positively influence business outcomes in their organization. 
The book provides detailed guidance on how to use the Microsoft Azure Digital Twins platform for a digital twin development and deployment along with sample code files available on Github.  By the end of this book, readers will have developed the skills to build and deploy a digital twin prototype, to demonstrate, assess, and monitor their assets at specific stages in the asset life cycle. 
  
“This book is a valuable resource to anyone starting their first industrial Digital Twin project, not just for the technical content, but also for the clear guidance on using Digital Twins to solve real-world business problems,” commented Dan Isaacs, CTO of the Digital Twin Consortium.  
Building Industrial Digital Twins is available now on Amazon in both Kindle and Paperback format.
