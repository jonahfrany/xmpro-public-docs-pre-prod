Our pre-built integrations serve as the building blocks for creating integrated composable digital twins that are not only scalable but also highly customizable to meet specific use cases. We understand that every organization has unique requirements, and our integrations provide the flexibility needed to tailor digital twins accordingly.
And now, we’re excited to unveil our latest addition to our existing Azure Data Explorer Agents, Our Reader Agent.
