# New XMPro Agent Integration: Linear Interpolation - XMPRO

URL: https://xmpro.com/new-xmpro-agent-integration-linear-interpolation/

Here at XMPro, we are constantly adding to our library of integrations for enterprise applications, data platforms, machine learning tools, and operational systems. These pre-built integrations allow our customers to efficiently extract meaning from various data sources by performing specific functions in their data streams. We like to call these integrations “agents”.
We are excited to announce that the linear interpolation function is the latest agent to join our catalogue.
This function will allow you to apply linear interpolation to your data points.
Linear interpolation is a method of curve fitting using linear polynomials to construct new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points
