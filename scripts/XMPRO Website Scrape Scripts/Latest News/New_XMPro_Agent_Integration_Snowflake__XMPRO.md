# New XMPro Agent Integration: Snowflake - XMPRO

URL: https://xmpro.com/new-xmpro-agent-integration-snowflake/

 
Here at XMPro, we are constantly adding to our library of integrations for enterprise applications, data platforms, machine learning tools, and operational systems. These pre-built integrations allow our customers to efficiently extract meaning from various data sources by performing specific functions in their data streams. We like to call these integrations “agents”.
We are excited to announce that the Snowflake Listener and Context Provider are the latest agents to join our catalogue.
These agents will help users include data from a Snowflake database in their data streams.
The Listener allows you to return new rows added to a table. It operates on a timed interval and returns all new rows added to the table since the last interval.
The Context Provider allows you to read and output the entire contents of a table to the Data Stream for contextual data.
For more information on our Snowflake Agents, please see our documentation site.
