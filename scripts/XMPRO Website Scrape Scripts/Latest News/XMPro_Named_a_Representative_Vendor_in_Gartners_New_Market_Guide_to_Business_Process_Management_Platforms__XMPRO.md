Dallas, TX, June 8, 2015 — XMPro is proud to announce that it has been named as a representative vendor in the Gartner Market Guide to Business Process Management Platforms.
According to the report, “By 2017, 70% of successful digital business models will rely on deliberately unstable processes designed to shift as customer needs shift.”
“XMPro’s Intelligent Business Process Management Suite is built on an event-based engine, rather than a traditional workflow engine. This gives organizations the flexibility to manage the unstructured work that comes from responding to business moments as they happen. We are honoured to be acknowledged for what we believe is an innovative approach to managing both structured and unstructured work through the XMPro platform”, said Pieter van Schalkwyk, CEO of XMPro.
