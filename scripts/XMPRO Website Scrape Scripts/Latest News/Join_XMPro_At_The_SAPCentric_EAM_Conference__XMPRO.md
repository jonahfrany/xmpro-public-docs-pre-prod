We’re excited to announce that XMPro will be exhibiting at the SAP-Centric EAM conference on March 5-7 at the Hyatt Regency in Huntington Beach, California. 
XMPro CEO, Pieter van Schalkwyk, will also be fielding questions about IoT at the conference’s Expert Exchange on Tuesday from 10:45.
The SAP-Centric EAM conference is the go-to event for Maintenance Managers and SAP EAM professionals to stay current on forward-thinking strategies, best practices and critical solutions for Enterprise Asset Management (SAP PM). It is an interactive experience rather than a sit-and-listen conference and showcases case studies, expert training and ample time to share ideas and experiences with fellow attendees. 
This year’s conference is co-located with the first annual SAP-Centric Materials & Logistics conference, providing even more value to your entire asset management and supply chain teams. Join a global community of users, decision-makers, partners, SAP experts, analysts and more, at the 13th annual event in 2017 to celebrate the people, technology, ideas and innovations that are transforming the way we work. 
Join us on March 5-7 in Huntington Beach to hear presentations covering your most pertinent challenges. For more information on this conference please visit http://sapeamconference.com/
