We’ve just released brand new XMPro connectors for SAP HANA & OSIsoft PI.
Using our visual Stream Designer, you can now drag and drop these connectors to use them in your IoT applications.
Our SAP HANA connectors make it easy to monitor SAP HANA tables for new records, read and display data for context and write data to SAP databases.
In addition to our existing OSIsoft PI Listener, we’ve added new connectors that allow you not only to read element data but also write data to OSIsoft PI Systems using AFSDK.
Here’s a quick overview of each connector:
