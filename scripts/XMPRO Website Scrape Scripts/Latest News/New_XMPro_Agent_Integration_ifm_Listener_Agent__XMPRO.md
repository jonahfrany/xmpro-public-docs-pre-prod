XMPro is constantly expanding our library of out-of-the-box integrations for enterprise applications, data platforms, machine learning tools, and operational systems. These pre-built integrations allow our customers to build scalable and highly customizable composable digital twins at speed.
We are excited to announce our latest integration, the ifm Moneo Listener Agent.
ifm moneoÂ is an IIoT platform that combines operation technology with information technology, to read and process sensor data generated in production plants.
It implements the OPC Unified Architecture protocol through which various systems and devices communicate by sending request and response Messages between Clients and Servers or Network Messages between Publishers and Subscribers over supported network types such as HTTPS and HTTP.
In this Client-Server model, a set of Services acts as the interface between Clients and Servers. Object information from the Server that is made available to the Client is called the Address Space and is exposed in formats such as XML and JSON.
The basic component of the Address Space is a Node, that contains values or references to other nodes. The referenced nodes represent the hierarchy structure.
The ifm Listener allows you to retrieve tag values of the selected nodes on the ifm moneo server.
