Dallas, TX, March 30, 2017 – XMPro will be showcasing its Agile Application Suite for Industrial IoT at Hannover Messe 2017 as part of the Industrial Internet Consortium’s Pavilion. 
XMPro looks forward to presenting its live IIoT ‘Factory in a Box’ demo at stand C24 in Hall 8 to give attendees a tangible example of the real-time IoT applications they can create to improve their operational performance. 
XMPro’s Agile Application Suite for Industrial IoT provides a visual, model-based approach for creating industrial IoT applications. This enables subject matter experts and engineers to prototype and deploys real-time IoT applications for a range of different use cases with little or no coding. The net result is that IoT use cases can be deployed in an agile, incremental fashion with the flexibility to change or refine applications as your needs evolve.
