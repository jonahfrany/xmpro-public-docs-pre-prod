 XMPro is proud to announce that it has been identified as a sample vendor in the Gartner “Hype Cycle for The Internet of Things, 2014” report. XMPro was named in both the Operational Intelligence and Intelligent Business Operations sections.
 Advice to IT leaders and business change agents from the report:
“Make operational intelligence a consideration in every major transactional application project and continuous process improvement program.”
Pieter van Schalkwyk, CEO of XMPro commented, “XMPro understands that the real benefit of the Internet of Things for commercial and industrial applications is not only the ability to monitor and control these devices remotely, but to log their data to create operational intelligence information from it. We believe being named by Gartner as a sample vendor reinforces the value of our approach to helping our clients harness the opportunities created by The Internet of Things.”
