# New XMPro Agent Integration: Geofence - XMPRO

URL: https://xmpro.com/new-xmpro-agent-integration-geofence/

We are pleased to announce the exciting addition of a brand new Function Agent, Geofence. 
The Geofence Function is used to check whether a certain Latitude and Longitude position is inside or outside a given geographic area. For example, to check if a moving asset is within a geographic area. This function supports Polygonal Geofences.
Polygonal Geofence
A polygonal geofence is created using a set of Latitude and Longitude values which, as the name suggests, represents a polygon.
 
You can use an online tool to create a static geofence file – which is primarily a CSV file of Latitude and Longitude pairs – an example can be found here. Or you can supply the data dynamically for a moving geofence.
Details for examples and configuration can be found in our Documentation.
There are a multitude of use-cases for geofencing that assist organisations across diverse industries to reach their goals. Here are just a few applications within asset-intensive industries such as mining, oil & gas and construction: 
At XMPro, we are continually adding to our library of integrations for enterprise applications, data platforms, AI learning tools, and operational systems. These pre-built Agents enable our clients to effectively extract meaning from different information sources by carrying out specific functions in their data streams.
