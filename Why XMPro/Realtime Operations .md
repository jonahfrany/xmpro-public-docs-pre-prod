# XMPro: Event Intelligence in Business Operations

## Transforming Business Operations with Real-Time Data

XMPro’s Intelligent Business Operations Suite (iBOS) incorporates Event Intelligence to improve how businesses manage and respond to real-time data. This technology enables more effective decision-making and operational responsiveness.

# What is Event Intelligence?

Event Intelligence in XMPro’s iBOS is defined by three key aspects:

# The Time Relevance of Data

Business users are continuously exposed to a deluge of event data or signals but still have limited insights into the meaning and impact of these events on business operations. There is often excessive latency between events and response actions with limited decision support and decision automation that result in inconsistent response to real-time business moments. Traditional Business Intelligence (BI) tools are not suited to analyze complex event signals in flight.

XMPro’s iBOS, powered by Event Intelligence, addresses several operational challenges:
