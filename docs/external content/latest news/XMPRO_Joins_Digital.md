Dallas, TX, June 19, 2020 – XMPRO, a leading provider in real-time digital twin applications, today announced it has joined the newly formed Digital Twin Consortium™. 
The Consortium will enable members across industries to collaborate on standards requirements, reference architectures and solving interoperability challenges for digital twins.  Led by a steering committee from Microsoft, Dell, Lendlease and Ansys, the Consortium will work to accelerate the digital twin market by creating best practices and industry guidelines. 
“Digital twin technology is becoming more pervasive as organizations adapt to an increasingly digital world. Over the past two years, we’ve seen adoption accelerate in industries like mining, oil and gas and manufacturing. But in order for us to harness the true potential of digital twins, we need to work together to address the challenges that come with deploying new technologies. We’re excited to be part of a global consortium that engages members from a variety of industries to create best practices for implementing digital twins,” commented Pieter van Schalkwyk, XMPRO CEO. 
The XMPRO platform enables engineers and subject matter experts to build complex real-time applications (including digital twins) without having to code. The platform makes it easy to connect to a variety of data sources, apply real-time analytics and trigger rule-based recommendations when specific events occur in your data. 
You can also embed interactive 3D models in your digital twin applications. Whether you’re building a digital twin for a specific asset type or an entire plant, you can virtually navigate and interact with its 3D model in real-time with XMPRO.
“We are delighted that XMPRO has joined Digital Twin Consortium,” said Dr. Richard Soley, Executive Director, Digital Twin Consortium. “Their experience with real-time digital twin applications will be invaluable to our other members as we work together to advance digital twin technologies.”
