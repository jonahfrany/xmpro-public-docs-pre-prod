“Great vision without great people is irrelevant.”  Jim Collins
XMPro’s team embodies our core values of innovation & commitment to excellence. We want to highlight the achievement of Dr. Carlos Riollano, a project manager at XMPro, who recently published his first book.
Dr. Riollano has been involved in project management for the past 20 years. He holds a Bachelor of Business Administration, Master of Technology Management and a Ph.D. in Organizational Management. He is one of the founding members of the PMI chapter in Puerto Rico and a mentor and founding member of the PMI Chapter in the Dominican Republic.
His new book, OPM3 and Organizational Culture, explores how considering organizational culture can add value to OPM3 by helping organizations sustainably manage improvements. Dr. Riollano has been using this combination of OPM3 and Organizational Culture in projects for the past 4 years with great results.
He is currently working on his second book, Project Management Discipline, Initiation and Planning, which will be published in Spanish. While his first book was academic in nature, the second will be a more hands-on, straight-forward guide to project management.
