The XMPro team showcased its “Factory in a Box” for the first time at this year’s IndustryWeek Manufacturing & Technology Conference in Rosemont, Illinois.
Our goal was to give conference attendees a tangible demo of our Agile Application Suite for Industrial IoT. And to show them how to get started with creating IIoT applications using real-time data from multiple sources.
The “Factory in a Box” features a number of different sensors to model the heterogeneous technology environment found in industrial enterprises today.
