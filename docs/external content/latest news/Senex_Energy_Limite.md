Senex has a thriving oil business and holds an impressive acreage position in Australia’s largest onshore energy precinct – the Cooper Basin. Following successful exploration in 2011/12 the company has achieved significant growth in oil reserves and production.
The company is an early mover in Australia’s unconventional gas industry and has already delivered encouraging results from its targeted unconventional gas exploration program in the Cooper Basin.
Senex also has strategically located coal seam gas acreage in the Surat Basin. In April 2012, the company was admitted to the S&P/ASX 200.
Senex Energy (Limited) is using XMPro for the authorisation of expenditure. This includes the automation, standardisation and conformity of the process.
