Dallas, TX, July 24, 2015 — XMPro is proud to announce that it has been listed as a “Sample Vendor” for Operational Intelligence Platforms in the Gartner Hype Cycle for Governance, Risk and Compliance Technologies.

XMPro’s Operational Intelligence provides the situational awareness needed as organizations are starting to deal with the challenges of real time operations.
