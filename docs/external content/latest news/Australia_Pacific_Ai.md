The XMPro Solution at APA manages their Corporate Credit Card expenses. The solution provides appropriate visibility with workflow for the allocation of transactions as well as the required escalations and notifications. The solution supports improved Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) Management and provides the functionality to manage disputes surrounding the validity of credit card transactions.
The APA needs to comply with a very high level of PCI standard (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) due to credit card transactions relating to e.g. flight bookings, parking, airport shops etc. XMPro complies with the security standards as set by the PCI.
