## Joint Solution Partners

Our Joint Solution Partners work with us to develop applications that typically focus on specific verticals or use cases.

This model combines the capabilities of our application development platform with our partner’s technology and industry-specific expertise to create a packaged solution that delivers fast time to value.

We also work with our partners to create a joint go-to-market strategy and actively promote the joint solution to our target audience.
