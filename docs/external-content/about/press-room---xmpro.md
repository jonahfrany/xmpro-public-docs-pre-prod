Logo Usage Guidelines
 

Our symbol and logo are bold and strong enough to be used individually, but generally speaking, our logo works best in our full version.
To maintain legibility, the XMPro logo should not be used at sizes below the prescribed minimum size.

Full logo: Print 10mm height | Digital 28px height
Symbol: Print 6mm width | Digital 28px width


We have defined clear zones around our logo to ensure the logo is protected and never crowded out by other elements. The minimum clear space around the logo is measured by the size of the letter O.
Our logo is flexible and can live on a light or a dark background.
Ensure that our logo colors are reproduced accurately and consistently.
Don’t distort our logotype in any way or apply any effects to it.
We don’t allow adding unauthorised words, phrases or other elements to our logo.
Don’t use backgrounds that interfere with the visibility of our logo.
