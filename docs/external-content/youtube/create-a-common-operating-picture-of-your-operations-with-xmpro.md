changing from a reactive to a

prescriptive way of working is one of

the biggest challenges for large

complex asset intensive organizations

like yours

enabling your own subject matter experts

to create an integrated common operating

picture that is strategically aligned

with your business objectives is the

only way to manage your operations in

real time at scale

you already have existing

complex infrastructure with fixed and

mobile assets and production facilities

that are in most instances

already instrumented with sensors plc's

and automation systems

these assets with sensors and iot

capabilities

generate a whole lot of signals and data

in near real time you also have many

disparate industrial and business

systems to capture store and analyze

these signals

and machine-borne data from your assets

typical systems in your organization may

vary from historians eam and erp systems

operational databases data lakes and a

plethora of other third party analytics

and engineering systems

these systems not only get signals and

data from the assets but also from the

transactional information from the

people in your business the new

generation business processes that

enable them

and the process automation needed to

manage this at scale

this is the real operational landscape

for your organization and many others

like you

changing from a reactive mode of

operation to prescriptive way that

includes predicting key events and then

advising the best course of action under

the current operating conditions

require a different way of finding and

responding to real-time events as they

happen

or are predicted to happen

you can't just rely on the alarms and

alerts from all the multitudes of

different systems that each notify you

in various modes on different platforms

or apps

and expect that

existing business processes can support

business users who

are already

stressed and have limited capacity

for them to be able to respond

effectively to this fire hose of the

alarm of alarms

changing from a reactive to a

prescriptive mode of operation requires

an integrated and

automated common operating picture such

as used in military and emergency

response

scenarios

now creating such a common operating

picture requires first finding the key

events that are happening or likely to

happen from all the millions of signals

and data points from these sensors plcs

and automation systems on your assets

and the information from your internal

business systems and then also

environmental signals from external

systems such as weather predictions

real-time commodity prices and other

and others to name a few

examples data streams provide a visual

way of connecting

disparate data sources using a library

of hundreds of integration connectors to

take the millions of signals and data

points and find the key events that you

are interested in

these events include asset performance

and utilization events such as

production maintenance quality safety

and lately esg events

the data streams identify these events

in real time by adding context from

existing business systems and applies

some form of analytic to this streaming

data

this analytic can be as simple as a

basic filter or as advanced as a neural

network ai model for example

it enables subject matter experts to

identify specific events of interest

and which is based on their knowledge of

your equipment and your operations

the next step is then

to make these key business events

accessible to the right people in your

business with the right information

at the right time

the xm pro app designer provides a drag

and drop interface for subject matter

experts to create a common operating

picture that aligns with the business

levers of your o of your business at all

levels of the organization

this ensures

that

how you respond to these key events

support the strategic initiatives of

your organization

the executive perspective provides a

strategic view that shows the event

intelligence a context of current and

forecasted kpis and business metrics

at the next level or tactical level the

event intelligence enables planning and

assessment of potential impact on

resources while at the operational level

a technician has a real-time view with

prescriptive recommendations on how to

respond in an effective and timely

manner all three levels look at the same

data and the same common operating

picture but with different lenses

in this way the common operating picture

approach differs from the single pane of

glass approach as it provides multiple

perspectives with all the information

and context based on the on the

application or the use cases for the

user which may differ from one to

another user it is still a single pane

for that user but those panes may differ

based on the role and the level and the

context that is needed

the common operating picture transforms

event intelligence into real time

operations intelligence delivered in the

users context this helps

people manage better it enables new

business processes that may not have

have existed before and potentially

provide business process automation to

handle much of this without human

intervention

the final step to move from reactive to

prescriptive operations is to provide

prescriptive recommendations for each

business event that needs to be

responded to

the exam pro recommendation engine

provides a common way to address events

in this common operating picture at all

levels

similar to going to the doctor for a

prescription and not just for a

prediction of an ailment you want to

provide prescriptive actions based on

the best practices

from experienced frontline technicians

from your equipment supplies and the

knowledge of your subject matter experts

like process and reliability engineers

the prescription is not just predicting

what is likely to happen but how to

respond how to mitigate risks and

potentially how to exploit an

opportunity

the exim pro recommendations provide a

consistent user interface at all levels

and

at all perspectives from this common

operating picture it is the same

experience at at the strategic level at

the tactical and operational levels

it further has the capability to

integrate alarms and alerts from

hundreds of third-party systems that

your organization want you to track

right now

it is possible to bring in all of those

in a consistent interface with this

approach to reduce the noise from all

the alarms and alert systems

and it also provides the same

prescriptive approach on how to best

address them

the prescriptive recommendations close

the loop on

responding to key events in the right

way at the right time

it is the automated event advisor that

provides guidance visibility

and accountability consistently across

all levels of your organization

this common operating

picture is a is an intelligent digital

twin approach that provides always on

situational awareness with prescriptive

guidance to empower your smartest people

to pull the

the levers that align with your business

strategy at all levels of your business

the common operating picture further

reduces the risk of being blindsided by

key business events that are happening

or likely to happen

and finally this common operating

picture provides

the opportunity to improve

accountability and closes the feedback

loop

that provides the visibility and

opportunity to learn as an organization
