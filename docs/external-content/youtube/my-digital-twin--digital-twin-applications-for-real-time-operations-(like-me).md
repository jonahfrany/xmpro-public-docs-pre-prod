everyone's talking about digital twins

but I find so many different definitions

and different understandings and I

thought I'd use myself as an example and

explain how digital twin applications

for real time operations can really help

organizations improve asset performance

and help find those unexpected events

that typically increase the risk and

cost us money so if you look at a

digital twin for myself so this is me

well this is a photo of me but this is

me and a couple of years ago at

Microsoft event Microsoft expire inspire

event they had a great set up where you

could stand on a rotating disc and they

were a couple of kinetic cameras and as

the disc spun it would take a 3d image

of you which they handed out so now I

have a 3d model of myself which I could

potentially use for a number of

different use cases I could I could

print a 3d model of myself I could

potentially fit some clothes on this 3d

model and see what brands would fit me

or what different colors would look like

but you know is this really a digital

twin of myself and looking at how

digital twins has evolved over the last

couple years I kind of came to the

conclusion that my smartphone is

probably a better representation of a

digital twin or myself then that 3d

model now if you look at the history of

digital twins it typically started off

as 3d or CAD based models where we try

to create a visual representation or

digital representation of a physical

object as as digital twins own evolving

we're starting to see that it's more

than just a 3d model but it actually

encapsulates a lot of the things that I

do it knows a lot about me in a number

of different areas now the smart phone

is a great example of this way there are

a number of different applications on my

phone that knows quite a lot about me so

if you look at the photos my phone knows

where I've been

what people I I've I've been in contact

with my families if it looks at Google

map data it will know where I've

traveled we have been like wise with

Instagram or Skype it'll mark

conversations well hopefully it doesn't

know all the the detail of the

conversation but it's a bit creepy that

when I when I get in my car it even

knows where I'm going so Google is

telling me you know you're heading there

and it'll take you this long to drive

there which again is a little bit creepy

in but in terms of predictive capability

of digital twins it kind of shows the

future of ways some of these things are

going and to be quite honest my phone

knows a lot more about me than anyone

else including my wife and close family

my my my phone knows absolutely

everything you know if we look at a

couple of examples around my my health

for example there are different number

of health apps and depending on what I'm

but what I want to use it for it's got

different sets of data that it that it

collects either real time or when I when

I'm using that specific app likewise

with finances it knows everything about

my investments my banks but my bank

account what I'm spending on my credit

card

the the the stocks that I'm invested in

and in terms of my travel where I've

been so in if you're looking at the

phone as a repository or as a single

front-end it's not a single database

with all the information in each

application has its own data source and

it can it can interchange so if you're

looking at the health apps it can

interchange some of the data so but but

but each app has got it its own data

source we its own way of collecting its

own analytics and it's only use guys

that it applies to but it's all

accessible from one single user

interface and it it's got the best

representation

of of knowing who I'm talking to

socially we have been what my financial

state is and also what my health is so

if I look at health in a little bit more

detail if you go into for example the

Apple health app it'll show you in terms

of your current performance in terms of

where you're in terms of activity and

things that you might have done it will

show you some of your records now some

of these are historical records anything

from and again this is whether it can

come from a sensor it could come from

doctors records there could be different

places where all this data comes from

but this is the single place where I can

see and this is the best digital

representation of myself it knows more

about my health than anyone else in one

single area so whether it is it is heart

health health records reproductive

health there's a broad range of of

different data sources and depending

again on the use case that I'm that I

want to use this health data for so in

my instance I'm a aspiring triathlete so

for example if I use Strava and one of

the things that I do I'd like to try and

based on on keeping my heart right at a

certain level

so that's real-time monitoring and

information that I'm that I need to know

and what does digital twin does he shows

me where I've been it gives me some of

the historical data for a specific

activity so I can look into that but I

can also see that real-time and you know

I can even have it on on a different

user interface like Apple watch where I

can actually see it real-time as I'm

doing the exercise and the other use

case for the same information is that my

family so when I'm at a race my family

can monitor me in real-time without

looking at the physical me if I just

look at

my twin or proxy on the internet so they

don't have to look at me they just look

at this there's avatar that I have on on

on the Internet and it uses the same

sensors that that feed the different you

eyes through the same IP eyes so each

app doesn't have to have its own sensor

data my phone for example the GPS is

used by multiple different applications

for their own use but it's the same GPS

location the same with any one of the

other sensors in the phone the other

interesting thing with this is I can

swap out equipment the underlying sense

the equipment so I can change my Fitbit

to a Garmin or have a new model of a

Garmin or whatever new and lightest fad

there is worth with the sensor based

technology that I use to collect this

data and it doesn't even blip on the app

the app doesn't even know because it's

just collecting the data through a

standard integration user interface and

if I swap out the underlying data source

the application and what I use this for

in this example my heart rate training

it does not even know that I've swapped

out the underlying equipment so looking

at this this is the best representation

of me if you wanted to know if from a

digital twin perspective again it knows

everything about me in terms of my

physical health financial health

my social life who I know what

conversations I'm I mean who I'm

connected to so this is the best digital

representation of myself and if we look

at our factory or plant or mine so how's

this different than just having my my

iPhone or my Android or whatever device

you're using as the as the the place

that serves all the applications well it

isn't really different so if

look at how we see it from my XM Pro

perspective we have all these different

apps so whether this is my Google Maps

or Skype or Outlook or whatever it is

that I'm that I'm using all my health

apps so let's say for example the

equipment maintenance that you see there

similar to do what you saw on the health

app if I go one level deeper into

equipment maintenance I can see the

different applications that I can that I

can set up as digital twin

representations so for example I can

create a centrifugal pump condition

monitoring or predictive maintenance

model the first is I two different

applications and they use the same

underlying data source and the way that

we set this up inside XM Pro is here's

my data flow or how I wire up my digital

twin from different data sources so in

this instance it's using OSI soft and

OPC UA and it's going through some logic

some analytics the same as what my phone

is doing when it's predicting where I'm

heading if you look at what Google Maps

are doing or what my time is going to be

if I run or and in this instance we're

predicting a certain equipments going to

file and then we are creating work

orders and sending our recommendation

and putting it on a dashboard for you to

see the interesting thing is I can swap

out OPC or or the OSI data source with a

different data source and it wouldn't

change what I'm seeing at the end what

might digital twin representation is the

thing that I'm getting at the end now

what this could look like again this

could be a dashboard similar to what

you've seen on this driver 1 + X employ

dashboards can have some historical data

some real-time status what is happening

right now coming from that data stream

the historical two ones could be looking

at at historical records similar to what

you've seen on the health app some

recommendations around what I should be

doing

and then current open tasks so looking

at this hydrocracking unit the digital

twin for this hydrocracking unit is

telling me quite a lot of information

around that so I don't have to go out to

the to the physical unit I can just look

at this if I look at a maintenance a

pump where a certain condition occurred

down that flow again a different style

of dashboard so every app can have its

own look and feel in terms of what the

dashboards look like inside exemplar but

I can see also other information coming

from my si B or Maximo or whatever

EAM system what current maintenance

we've got planned what did we do

recently so bringing in some of that

transactional information again like the

health records and we're not replacing

it so this is not one mega uber big

digital twin it actually connects to the

data that sits in the different places

it's not replacing it it's also not

replicating it it is merely showing it

you in the context of the application

that you're trying to use it in in this

instance I want to either on the right

hand side and select a certain action

whether it's grading work orders

requesting space escalating into

engineering to have a look at this and

review it all the different use cases

and yes I can have the 3d models

embedded as part of that as part of this

decision support in this digital twin so

as you can see there's no difference

between how I use my smart phone as my

digital twin representation there is no

difference in terms of how you can set

up digital twin applications for

real-time operations monitoring and

operations management

now just to explain a little bit in

terms of at what level does a digital

twin sit well it can actually sit at any

level it really depends on what your use

case is so it might be that I've got

that I specifically want to look at this

gear box on the Bommel and that might be

a simple twin so I've got a simple

dashboard simple monitoring

or it might be a composite twin which is

assembly of a number of different

individual twin components and this

creates my ball more unit so this is for

one ball more all my use case might be I

need to look at the total throughput

throughput in my whole processing plant

and for that this ball mill is just one

of the components so again this digital

twin can fit into a broader or bigger

application which we call kind of a

system based composite and digital twin

and then just in terms of the proxy as I

said when I was running the rice my

family didn't have to look at me

physically they could look at my proxy

which is really that digital twin and I

could see where I am and what my

performance is life without a digital

twin if for all the different use cases

that you have operations maintenance

safety and like a whole number of

different ones quite often you end up

having different or senses that

duplicate or replicate the same

information and every kind of use case

has got its own sensors on operations

have their own sensors and information

that they're collecting and it creates

these silos of different information the

benefit is if you're using this digital

twin approach now I just think of myself

with my phone in the middle and the

different use cases that I have like

health finance and whatever the case

might be where the phone rate with all

these little blocks represent the

different applications on my phone

likewise on a plant if I've got a well

platform and I use the concept of a

digital twin which can contain physics

based models analytics models so the

physics based models classically where a

lot of these things thought it with

finite element methods and some of the

engineering things like thermodynamics

analytical model some of the newer

things that we're seeing around

predictive capability all the time

series data and historical data that we

are collecting around time time values

and then is a transactional data sitting

in your piece around maintenance master

data around what is the equipment when

did we buy it and visual models like

like the CAD and 3d and and some of the

others so as you can see there is no

difference between myself and my iPhone

versus your plant and its digital twin

and it's in different use cases
