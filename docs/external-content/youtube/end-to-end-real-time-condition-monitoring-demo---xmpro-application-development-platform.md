this is a demonstration of an end-to-end

condition monitoring solution

brought to you by movis rising and xm

pro

here's a look at the high level process

flow

we're going to start with movis where

the alarm is generated

this is the movis interface where we can

see alarms generated by

sensors on particular assets in this

instance the slow feeder number 9

conveyor has triggered an alarm

we're now going to move into xm pro to

see how you can respond to this alarm

as you can see on our image map conveyor

number 9 is highlighted with a red

circle around it

and in the top right you'll see a

recommendation that's come through

from the movis sensor if you click

into that particular asset to drill down

you'll get some more information

and on the left you'll see the

recommendation as well

drilling into that will open up the

recommendation information

in the top left you'll see the event

data for this particular alert

and on the right there are work

instructions to walk you through

how you could potentially respond to

this recommendation

now you'll want to create a notification

in your sap

eam system so you type in the word yes

and save this recommendation if you

close

it'll bring you back to the drill down

for this particular asset

and if you then go back into the

recommendation you'll actually see the

sap notification number

that was automatically generated for you

now we'll look at how this continues in

the sap

platform as soon as you typed in yes and

saved that particular recommendation

the integration automatically created a

work notification inside sap

which is what is highlighted on the

screen here

from there you can generate the specific

work orders for the required maintenance

you can also update and change any of

the notifications

as you need to inside sap what we're

pulling through

is the exact same work instruction

information

that was seen in the xm pro

recommendation screen

that's being passed through to sap as

well so it will be available

to your users in here when they're

interacting with this notification

if you mark that notification as

complete it will close out the

recommendation

all the way through so if you go back

into xm pro

you'll see that this particular

recommendation has been closed out

and there are no active recommendations

for this particular asset

and that all happens automatically in

the background

this also gets updated in the movis

interface

if you go back to xm pro and you open up

your archive

you'll see the closed out recommendation

you can look at the event data

and see the comments that have been

passed back from sap

into the recommendation so it'll be

available in your history

if you ever need to go back if you

return to the main view where we started

you can actually see that the alert on

belt 9 is now clear

of an end-to-end condition monitoring

solution
