the exemplar app designer is a low or no

coda vendor of an application

development platform that enables

subject matter experts to create and

deploy real-time event intelligence

applications without being a programmer

this means that engineers and subject

matter experts can build applications in

days or weeks without further

overloading IT and this enables the

organization to accelerate and scale

your digital transformation initiatives

so let me run you through the app

designer quickly we've covered the data

streams in a previous video and this is

where the information typically comes

from as well as other business sources

where we even now create the

applications and provide the

visualization which then also drives the

recommendations and other actions that

we are doing in the next step this is

the XM Pro app designer and it shares

categories worth the data stream

designer and other modules if I drill

down into one of these categories I find

all the different applications that I've

created under that categorization in

this instance let's look at an image map

and this is now the real-time view that

end user would see where it shows me the

real-time data that comes from the data

streams it then applies the

recommendation rules and as you can see

there are a number of exceptions that

occur and I can now interface and I can

do and respond to these recommendations

and drive the actions that I'm trying to

do now if I have access and the real

power of the system is enabling the

subject matter experts because I have

access I can now build and deploy these

apps I can even make changes so it

allows for the agility and I can

drag-and-drop

different user interface components also

in terms of layout I could have

components I could drag on charts gauges

images and different things that I need

I can even combine some of these

components and turn them into widgets

which just speeds up the whole process

for myself

another subject matter specifically

because I can share these widgets with

with other subject matter experts and we

can then very quickly build new

applications that contain pre-built

components that we give that that we can

reuse and again the benefit of that is

it really speeds up the process I can

wire it up to the data streams I can

also wire it up to some of the other

business information that we have and I

can wire it up to the recommendation

rules that we set up to detect the key

events that are that are impacting our

business so this is what the app

designer is it's a low code environment

to build applications that have data

they've got images that's good and that

have actions that drive the responses to

events that happen in our business
