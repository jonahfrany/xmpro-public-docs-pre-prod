Welcome to XMPro's insightful monthly webinar series. In this edition, spearheaded by our expert, Gavin Green, we delve deep into the transformative world of digital twins, emphasizin...
hello everybody and welcome to today's

uh webinar my name is Gavin Green I look

after strategic solutions for for exm I

want to thank you all for attending

today uh if you have any questions uh

put them into the uh the chat uh I think

there's question section as well I'll

try and get to them at the end as we go

through it so in today's webinar what

we're going to go through is how to

accelerate your digital twin use cases

using our blueprints accelerators and

pattern as

well before we start though uh we just

need to make sure that we're aligned on

some of the terminology um make sure

that when we're talking um an

accelerator or pattern everyone's on the

same page um on the topic so to do that

U it's easier if I just open it up and

we just go through this so starting from

the bottom um each of these tends to

build on each other so patterns um on

the far right here we see these as

preconfigured data streams we also see

widgets and I'll explain what the

difference is when I go into that uh

form part of the patterns um on on the

right

here the

accelerators um that is typically a

Jupiter notebook from our AI or our

notebook section um it could also be one

or two pages um it could also be a set

of recommendation s with the data Stream

So it builds on the patterns just a

little bit more and then blueprints

blueprints you could see those as

pre-built Solutions so they're typically

around a specific use case um and they

will contain data streams

recommendations um some app

visualizations templates

Etc what are some of the benefits by by

using templates um why are we having

this discussion around blue accelerators

and patterns and what does it mean for

for me and and my organization uh for

for those watching

today so some of the key benefits uh for

this is lower cost of deployment you can

integrate your Silo data um using best

practices you're going to shorten your

time to Value um and that plays into the

next one as well which is improving your

internal personal productivity you don't

have to spend a lot of time working all

the intricate details and and bits some

pieces up you can use this as your

starting platform um and then just adapt

it and change it to your own

requirements as

well you can increase your return on

your value proposition again these all

tie into the shorten time to Value piece

of the top which is really U the key

thing here around all three of them it

doesn't matter if it's a pattern an

accelerator or a blueprint it really is

how do we do things a lot quicker um and

get to our end result a lot faster the

the last one is an

interesting you can get the domain

Knowledge from our partners as well as

ourselves around certain use cases again

you can import these adapt them change

them to your own requirements um but

just some of the benefits of using the

uh the templates

themselves when it comes to our suite of

um products which pieces do these touch

it's going to touch all four them it's

going to touch the data streams the AI

the app designer and also the

recommendation manager as well so it

touches all four of them as you see them

here coming back to my um Iceberg

analogy slide patterns you'll find right

down the bottom here the the patterns

are touching the uh the data stream side

so the DS data wrangling analytics

integration orchestration when we start

talking around the accelerators

accelerators will be touching the AI

piece they could be touching the

recommendation manager piece as well as

the data stream and then you have your

Blueprints and blueprints will go from

the top all the way down whether it's

the app designer recommendations AI or

data streams the notice down the bottom

there the subscription manager we don't

actually touch anything in the

subscription manager for all three of

them so pattern accelerators or or

blueprints the subscription manager is

just where you control your access to

the different pieces so remember when

you're importing and creating your your

different uh blueprints uh or even your

accelerators make sure you set up the

correct access for your team uh if you

want to share them either read access or

write access to them as well if you

don't do that no one else will be able

to use those different components as

well so let's dive into what is it that

we're actually looking at here and and

how do I get a hold of them

if I go into our documentation website

um on the far left you will see there is

a link which says blueprints

accelerators and patents what that will

do is that'll take you to a website this

website is hosted in GitHub itself and

you can see blueprints accelerators and

pattern if we start at the bottom and

work our way all the way to the Top If

we go to patterns it will list all the

different patterns that we have

published now publish these if you wish

to contribute I will have a link right

at the end which will walk us through

how to contribute um and make your own

patterns accelerators or blueprints

available here and you can merge them in

as well pattern is broken up into two

main sections um that I have available

here the AI these will be data streams

and then widgets which will be used in

the app

designer this is a constantly evolving

site as we have new um items added in

either of the three sections they will

be added to these Pages um and you'll be

able to access them as well if you click

the view details on any of them it'll

take you down into the actual component

itself so this is the asset monitoring

using binary classification across the

top you have your visuals so if you

click into those you can actually see

what they look like from the visual

perspective just clicking out of that

will'll close them on the left you will

see all the pages will have a set of

common items the one is going to be the

import password whenever you try and

import anything it doesn't matter if it

is a widget it doesn't matter if it's a

data stream recommendation or an app you

need an import password we use the same

password for all of these items just to

make it easier for people to integrate

um and and use these all you can do is

just double click and copy this

particular password Here

and then you can use it when you're

importing if you're looking for

instructions and how to import you can

click this particular link here it will

take you to our documentation site which

will list out the import export um and

all the different components from our

documentation S as well does not matter

if it's a data stream uh recommendation

Etc it's all on this particular site

here on how to import it'll walk you

through the different details um for

that as well and then lastly there'll be

a file section which will contain the

various components that you are going to

need this particular example has two

there's a SQL script and there's a data

stream if you go and open the script

you'll notice that it'll actually take

you to the uh repository at the back

which has the components that you need

to actually run it so in this example

this would be the SQL script so you can

just copy the actual text here run this

against your SQL environment go back and

now you can and open up the data stream

and again you can just download the

actual data stream to import it as

well it does not matter if this is a

full blueprint and I'll show you a few

examples on that as well it follows the

same principle here with regards to the

section on the left components in the

middle you'll see a table of contents

will allow you to jump around different

items that we're looking at the data

stream will just highlight what are some

of the items that are used used in the

data Stream So if you want to learn a

little bit more you want to get a bit

more comfortable with the particular

pattern in this example which of the

agents are we using and again each of

these will take you and allow you to

drill down into that

particular um documentation and you can

find out more information as as you want

to or or need to right at the bottom are

the typical steps to follow to import it

does not matter if this is again a

package an accelerator or a blueprint

you're going to follow the very similar

steps to import the key thing at the top

there though is making sure that you

have a set of variables defined these

variables are typically create created

when you're installing a site but again

it's just good to make sure that you

have them when you are importing so what

do I mean by by these variables you need

to have specific access and you'll

notice here on the left there is

variables I'm in the app designer right

now I just click the uh hamburger and I

click variables it'll open up the

variables for

me what we're looking for is to make

sure you have the app designer URL and

the app designer integration key you

will notice that there is an app

designer URL inside the app designer and

if we go into the data streams you will

find one in there as well just a

reminder variables are shared so if you

define it in the app designer it'll be

available in the data stream and vice

versa however you do need to apply your

variables in both systems the reason for

that is each of them is using a

different encryption key um specifically

when you are encrypting the values in

here so just keep that in mind when you

are actually creating or confirming the

variables that you set them in both

environments you'll see here in the app

designer I can go down and I can see my

integration key if I go into the data

stream you can see I've set them as well

if you have not set them how do you know

you can see all the items here which

have the Chevron next to them have not

been set in the app designer whereas in

the data stream designer they have been

set so that's how you can very quickly

tell have they' been configured or not

do you need to configure them in both

environments it depends on your use case

and how you're going to use these

particular

variables inside the app designer I'm

not going to be using the actual too or

the ml flow capabilities but inside my

data stream I am that's why they are

configured for me in

here so important across the top make

sure that you have these defined to be

able to use this um data stream in this

example you'll notice that we're talking

around SQL username password down here

the reason we are is a lot of the

accelerators and pattern um are set to

specific data sources that we have

defined now when you are actually

loading in these accelerators by just

open up this particular one that we are

looking at

here you will see in this data stream we

have two items one which is going to be

where's my data coming from but two

where is my context coming from if you

want to change your context you can U

just make sure that over here you

obviously creating the variables to

whatever system you are changing it to

when you load it in so step one is

really just confirming your variables

where are you going to be getting your

data from um to to be able to do

anything the app designer these two here

is required when you are trying to run a

recommendation using a recommendation

manager or you are looking to pass data

to our visuals that is why you've

defined the two of those if you do not

have that def you will not be able to

use these two agents on this particular

data stream

itself second run the SQL script so here

you will see the smart meter again if I

open that up in another window you will

see what it is you actually creating and

configuring again do you have to use

this um in your own environment no by

all means you can swap that piece out

and drag on another context Provider

from the library as you need to or want

to bring it

in second importing the data

stream so first thing that you would

need to do is make sure that you

download the data stream uh from this

particular environment here so you can

see here is the data stream um itself

the extension U uh Fu so here I can just

click the download and it'll download

the actual carile for me to be able to

use

all

next thing we want to import that

particular data string it follows the

same process um if you go into the data

streams you will see there is an import

option if you click that it's going to

ask you for a file key this file key is

this key that we've copied across the

top here which is the input password

again we use the same password for all

three sections just to make it a lot

easier for folks to to use so you just

put the key in there and now you can

actually please select the file to to uh

to

upload and now we can say upload what

this will do is it will check your site

as well and it'll do the same for

recommendations it'll do the same for

for apps um if it picks up that there is

already a version of that it's going to

ask you a question you want to import it

as a new version what you want to import

it is a completely new entity of that

then this one is a data stream so I'm

going to get the option there it'll do

the same for a recommendation it'll do

the same for an app as well if you want

to just say a new version uh it'll just

increment the version and create this

system new version even if that app

recommendation or data stream is

published it'll create a new version but

it's not going to take that version live

you still need to go in and edit it and

change it because this is a data stream

it's going to ask me where do I actually

want to uh run it and I can put it into

the correct collection make sure that

you are following the um the actual

blade itself it's going to ask you

different question depending on what it

is that you want to import for the

different areas if I go into my new data

stream I can give it a name put it in a

category but again I slap my collection

designation um as

well once we've imported that then it is

available for for our use and as I go

into this particular

example

you can now change and configure it so

next step once we've imported it assign

access to others as required again

applies to all the different areas um as

well you need to decide who else is

going to be using this uh with you

because this is the data stream we can

go into the manage access and make sure

you're giving access to the correct

people also Define what type of access

you want to give them you want to give

them read access write access or coowner

access uh to it as well read access will

just allow you to view the co components

and content right will allow you to edit

and co-owner access will typically allow

you to change other people's access

rights to it as well if you have read

access to items you cannot publish or

unpublish uh that component whether it

is a data stream whether it's a

recommendation or whether it's an actual

app itself all you can do is edit and by

edit I mean you can go in and configure

and see what the items are you can make

changes to it it'll give you the little

ascts that will ask you to say but as

soon as you try and save it'll tell you

you do not have access to that and you

will not be able to save it um as

well

important have a look at the different

components that you and this is

specifically important with regards to

the the data streams themselves when

you're importing them you need to make

sure that you double click anything that

that is a exm Pro app and it's correctly

configured to use the URL and the key

the same for the recommendation make

sure that it is correctly set up to use

the uh the key and the uh the URL as

well what you also need to do is make

sure that your context provider is

pointing to whatever data source it is

that you've defined this one is pointing

to the SQL um because we've loaded the

SQL um across the top into there as well

so you need to make sure that that's

been defined as well the recommendation

make sure it's pointing to the correct

URL key just click apply save um and

that should be all you need to do the

entity items um the different components

down here you don't need to remap those

or reset those all you really need to do

is just make sure that your connection

properties are set typically your URL in

your key if I come into the SQL again

make sure that it's pointing to the

correct instances here making sure it's

your correct database your correct and

it'll automatically start filling in the

rest of the items for you as

well and then right at the bottom just

clicking apply publish and ensure that

you are getting data coming through for

for all of these but once you've

configured everything and it is ready to

go make sure you hit publish go to the

live view um and

typically pick the uh the item before

the Run recommendation as well as the

the app so here you'll see predict is

the the item coming out the AI post

elemetry is coming out of the action

agent depending on the data stream that

you've configured it'll take a bit um

just to run this one's running a

predictive model loading a lot of data

and contextual data so it'll take a

little bit of time to come through make

sure you've got the data flowing through

this particular section here before you

continue onwards I.E going in loading an

app loading a recommendation

Etc you can see the data is coming

through now across the top which means

we've configured this correctly and we

can either leave it running um and

continue on to the next step or we can

unpublish it depending on what the use

case for this item

is

accelerators if I go into into the top

we'll tend to build on patterns but

before we go into accelerators there's

this another area on P which is around

widgets now what a widget is is it is

into the realm of the app designer and

it really is how do I create individual

components that I don't have to spend a

lot of time trying to move everything

Pixel Perfect uh for it so what we've

done here is we've curated a list of a

lot of different widgets that we tend to

reuse over and over again just to make

it quicker and easier for folks to

actually use inside the app designer

again it's going to follow the same

principle across the top you will have

your um visuals these visuals here you

will see uh this is what the actual run

space will look like there is the

configure space um as well because this

is inside the app designer there's two

themes there's a light theme and a dark

theme on the left you have your same

thing which is importing the password as

well as a file as well as a widget so if

I open up that particular widget you'll

see it will take me again back into the

uh GitHub repo and it'll allow me to

download those particular um files

themselves so where are these uh widgets

and and how do I use them inside the app

designer if I go into a particular

application so I'm going to go into my

one example here if you go into the edit

mode as if you were configuring a

particular app

itself on this particular area here here

you'll see under blocks on the left

there's a widget section you have two

icons here which will allow you to

export a widget or import a widget if

you tell it you want to

import it's going to ask you for a key

this is the same key that we've got

across the top that is what we're

interested in so you paste the key there

and then you upload the actual widget

file itself that you are interested in

all of the widgets have a file that will

allow you to import that particular

widget so the depending on what it is

that you are looking to actually use and

reuse in your applications you just load

the appropriate widget for that where

the widgets actually appear is if you

expand

the the accordion you'll see all your

widgets will appear here as

well if I drag one on you will notice

that it will drag the item in for me as

well most of the widgets that we

configure will be from a Content card

perspective so you'll see here we have

card and here is a Content card that

will actually drag it in if I drag in

the other one you'll see this one is

dynamic and this one is

static why do we have two of these items

depending on your use case the one on

the right here means I have a static

view it's not going to change um I'm

only going to have so many columns you

can now come in and change as you want

to or need to so if you are not

interested in having all the columns you

can come in and actually remove a column

now I've only got three

columns each of these if you click on an

item and go to page layers you will

notice that there is typically a data

source that's been defined in the page

layer themselves so if I click the data

source it will allow me to bind this to

a particular data source itself so here

I can go into the page data create

myself a u data source typically

pointing to a data stream and if I go to

the block properties I can actually bind

this this particular data source um to

it and now I can come in and start

binding as I would normally the actual

text to any of the properties coming in

from that particular data source

itself all the widgets function in a

very similar faction where anything that

has data sources will allow you to map

them and move them as well again this is

a static this one's a little bit more

Dynamic what that means is you'll notice

this section here we've only to find one

the data source is going to dictate how

many columns it's actually going to be

creating for me and you'll find this

pattern follows through in a lot of the

actual widgets themselves there will

typically be a static one but there will

also be a dynamic one whether it's

columns or rows which will allow you to

grow um the actual um app pieces itself

if I click in here and go to the page

layers you'll see there is the total

data source and there is the child data

source so this is typically where you

would put the data source um itself and

then you just map the items and then

it'll configure everything for you I

mentioned two themes the widgets unless

otherwise specified will function in

both themes themselves so if I go into

the dark theme and I drag these two

widgets in as well you will notice that

they will be colored appropriately um

and they will match that particular

theme itself so if I go and actually

launch this you can see there are my um

items if I go to my live theme there are

my items as well because I bound this

one to the data source you will notice

that it's actually going to duplicate

the items so let's go in there let's

remove the data source for the uh the

moment and we can then have a look

at how this is actually rendering so

this is what it would look like in the

live theme this is what it would look

like in the dark

I didn't have to change anything um I

didn't have to edit anything I can just

drag them on use them and configure them

as I need to and that follows the same

for pretty much all the widgets um in

here and there's a lot of different

widgets um in here um this list is

constantly being added to we're

constantly growing it um if you have

something that you feel You' like to put

in here by all means send it to send it

in or contribute it um as well um to

this particular list the last it I'll

touch on is blueprints so inside

blueprints we're building on the other

two um items themselves so pattern

typically you have your um data streams

and widgets inside accelerators you will

see here these are typically onepage

apps so this one here would be um I've

just got a visual which is just showing

me 3D items and how do I bind them to a

Unity view so there is an app over here

and there is a data stream again it'll

walk you through what are some of the

key pieces in it but the steps you'll

notice is very similar to what we've uh

just gone through with the the patent

confirming your variables importing what

you need to do importing the application

um and then just running it from from

there inside the accelerators there is

an AI section as well so here if I open

this up we'll load the um quick start

guide or um our Jupiter notebooks or our

notebooks ourselves any of the other U

notebooks that we make available will

appear in here as well and we'll

function under the

accelerator coming into blueprints

you'll notice they just keep building on

each other here so the blueprints

themselves if I go into a particular

example in here across the top you have

your visuals again you can click through

that and see what all the different

components are in that um blueprint

itself on the left you just just have a

lot more items to

import you still got the same

instruction you still have the same

password here you have your application

and template there are the

recommendations data stream and any um

data scripts that are needed same

principle applies here when you are

importing your data streams you can

adjust and change where your data is

coming from you can also adjust and

change your recommendations so if the

thresholds are not to your liking change

and adjust them as well you'll see same

pattern make sure your variables are

defined running any of your scripts U

that need to be run there is a sequence

to importing a

blueprint um typically you will import

your data streams then you'll import

your

recommendations uh there are times when

you may be importing a second data

stream in between the two especially if

it's working on a recommendation that

will be called out in the actual steps

themselves and then last you'll import

your application for it when you're

importing your application you'll notice

down here it'll call out specific steps

that you need to do this is when you're

linking to

recommendations um and where you need to

do that the reason for doing application

last is if you were to do application

first one of the options on an import is

going to ask you to bind it to the

different data streams if you've not

imported those data streams left you can

leave it blank but you're going to have

to go and manually set that up

afterwards that's why the application is

typically lost because you already

imported your data streams you've

imported your recommendations and you

should just be able to match everything

when you import it it makes the

experience a lot quicker and a lot more

pleasant when you are loading those

in if we come back to to the items um

that we've got here again there's three

areas that typically build on top of

each other patents accelerators and and

blueprints so how do I contribute and

where do I get access uh to these so for

contributions um the link across the top

that QR code will take you straight to

that particular link itself or for

direct access you can click that link at

the bottom as well um if you don't want

to remember those particular links what

you can do is just go to our

documentation website documentation.

xo.com click the uh the link on the left

and it'll take you to that website as

well perfect um while I keep this up

here let's see if we've got any

questions from from anyone on the

audience we do okay so the one question

here is is around contrib okay so if you

want to contribute there's two ways you

can contribute um to it uh if you're not

comfortable loading them into the

repository or where to put it or how to

style it by all means you can send it to

us whether it's a pattern an accelerator

or blueprint what we'll do is um load it

ourselves and give you the um correct

attributes as to where it came from to

to load it in there if you are more

comfortable uh what you can do is you

can Fork the repository uh check it in

and then we can actually merge that in

uh once it's been rated and checked and

then it'll be available for everyone

else to to load in as

well next steps uh just before we wrap

up here um to remember to to register

for next month's webinar again there's

two options for it um here we'll be

hosting a a hoty Q&A session around

predictive maintenance and continue uh

condition monitoring as well any

questions you can reach out to our um or

our team for more information and again

thank you all for attending today have a

great rest of uh rest of your day
