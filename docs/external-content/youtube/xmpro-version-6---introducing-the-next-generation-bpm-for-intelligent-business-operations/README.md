thank you and welcome to this webinar

which introduces x-impro version 6 which

is we feel the next generation of

intelligent business process management

switch suites for intelligent business

operations and i'll explain as we go

what we mean by that

and we actually sort of see it as ibus

or

our intelligent business operation suite

so exam pro bank forward

is has grown from from version five and

the features that we'll be covering

today are essentially what we call

version six ibus features i'm not

covering the basic bpm functionality

you can ask one of you can ask us or one

of our partners to do a full

presentation on the powerful features of

xm pro

that it's got currently in

up to version five all the standard

process management workflow what we'll

be focusing on today is really what

makes

version six the ideal platform

for your intelligent business operations

and what does it mean in the first place

and to understand a little bit more of

what intelligent business operations

mean i just like to touch very quickly

on something that i picked up

from garten at the gardener id expo and

essentially

what janelle hill was saying

is that

right now we are right now in business

there's so much

there's newer technologies including

social media context aware technologies

cloud environments intelligent phones

and devices and all of these rev and

revolutionize the way that we work so

the way that we work is actually

changing

and what gartner is saying is

enterprises have not yet empowered

frontline employees to dynamically

adjust their work in progress

in response to the contextual

opportunities or threats and

software has barely been applied to

knowledge centric work

decision making

risk assessments pattern seeking

matching

group collaboration all of those have

been supported as point solutions up to

now but there's been nothing that brings

it all together

and right now

with the leading economies that are

increasingly dependent on service based

industries

it's becoming heavily dependent on

knowledge work information and knowledge

workers and these people are overwhelmed

with data and choices that's where we

find ourselves and most of our customers

at the moment so

what is business and

what is intelligent business operations

to me it's a state of business it's not

really something you can buy it's not a

methodology it's really just a state of

where the business is it's almost like

the bpm maturity curve or any one of

those maturity curves that takes you

from a level zero to a level five

intelligent business operation is a

state in that process

and the way that we achieve that is by

leveraging some of these things that are

now available and when you look at them

essentially there's three main

components to what i see

intelligent but what gives you the state

of intelligent business operations and

the first one is to

be able to cater for knowledge style

work that means not everything can be

structured

you need to have structured and

unstructured processes in

organizations secondly

those processes also need to be dynamic

so there's a convergence of

of unstructured there's a requirement

for dynamic rules based rather than flow

based workflow driven we would

there's a requirement of event driven

actions and these event-driven actions

are actually working towards a business

goal the kpi

one of your

balanced scorecard

kpis or something like that it includes

predictive analytics it's trying to

understand what have we done in the past

looking at process mining and combining

all of this to be able to

dynamically change

based on the context and the information

that we have at that point in time and

something else that we are all aware of

but we've not been able to capture as

part of as as part of our the way that

we do business is to include those

social conversations around the water

cooler

and they essentially in and around

business transactions what we mean by

that some conversations happens around

business how do we improve ourselves

others happen around

very specific transactions

so

what are the benefits of intelligent

business operations the first one is

really just better business decisions

what we don't want to do is actually

force someone down a a specific path

when they have better contextual informa

when they know the context of a process

all that we want to do is give them as

much information as we can at that point

in time for them to make better

decisions so what we want to do is

empower those knowledge workers and we

want them to act in a non-prescriptive

way

if you take a factory style where

everything works in a very prescriptive

way and it's well worked out and there's

a

a a a

a jet principle or anything like that

just in time um it's it's worked out to

the to the finite element of of what

every work activity should take how long

it should take what the next one is

knowledge workers don't work like that

they don't want to work in a

prescriptive way because they have

contextual knowledge but we still need

to put that into some control framework

we can't just let them loose and do

anything that they want to and in in

exon pro version six we will show you

we'll demonstrate um how we control how

we do some of these

principles that we talk about here

a lot of companies have spent a lot of

money on business intelligence tools but

what you want to do is make those

business intelligence insights

actionable what do you do with the intel

that you're gathering how do you action

it how do you make sure things happen

with it how do you how do you make sure

people look forward and use it rather

than just looking at a rear view mirror

business intelligence dashboards can be

almost like a rear view mirror it shows

you what happened if you want to take if

you want to make it actionable you need

to take those business intelligence

elements those insights and actually

make them part of the process going

forward so that you can actually look

forward instead of looking

backwards and then lastly we will also

the other benefit that we get out of

intelligent business operations is that

we we can actually improve the

collaboration by harnessing the social

interaction now there's many ways of

people socializing and we're trying to

capture some of them as part of the way

that we that we work we want to get

better at getting work done which is

essentially what xmpro is all about so

just once again to to

emphasize the three elements of

intelligent business operations that

exxonpro address is the ability to have

unstructured processes

to have dynamic processes

and to have social processes

as i go through the

the presentation will actually show you

these three elements in terms of how we

handle them in version six so to start

off with unstructured processes and as

you'll recall i said structured and

unstructured processes are there to

support a knowledge style work

gartner has come out and said 80 of work

is unstructured so

and and that is primarily in the

knowledge worker space so this is where

people sales people

customer service

right down to to

financial

office

chief marketing officer office all of

those

processes are actually there's a whole

lot of unstructured work in after fact

we actually find that that there's more

of a hybrid model that 20 percent of a

process

is structured and 80 of a process is

unstructured so we it's not just that

you can discreetly say or or

quite easily define which processes are

are

structured and which are unstructured

you always in many instances you

actually find a combination of those

processes that are that are like that

and what you also find is when you look

at real world business processes there

are generally more exceptions than rules

that means if you're going to try and do

take a workflow based approach where you

draw out the you draw the flow of how

this thing will work you're going to

find that with all the exceptions you're

going to run out of paper

unstructured processes say we have a

collection we have a container

and for a process and we can call that

customer onboarding for example and in

that container we can put all the events

that can that can occur and we can

sequence them as we need them we talk

about we sequence them at runtime rather

than at design time so we don't design

the flows but we do put those process

elements in there

the other one is that knowledge workers

have context people have information and

they make decisions based on that and

based on that they want to determine the

routing so for example a salesperson

will know or may have read or

that there's a issue with a

current

prospect that is going through a um

a customer onboarding process

um they may have read in the paper heard

something on the tv news and what they

want to do is actually do a credit check

right there and then so instead of

waiting for the prescriptive workflow

that says

you have to do it in step six we

actually want to do it right now so

knowledge workers have context what we

want to do is enable them to make better

decisions so

when we look at dynamic and all of those

processes so those elements we will

actually also introduce some of the

analytics

that we have

but right now we just want to make sure

that people have the option

based on the information that they have

to route it to a different place

so if we look at

an unstructured process one of the

challenges that we have found is

knowledge style work

if you use email or any one of those

other

ways and means of trying to manage it

that you actually don't have an order

trial of this knowledge style work you

only you only have order trials

of the discrete workflow based work that

you have but none of this work this

knowledge style because the tools up to

now haven't been able to support that so

if you've got a underlying workflow

engine as the as the driver for your for

your process management

then you can't cater for this knowledge

style work

customer service is a typical style of

this

what we call knowledge style so

it depends on what the customer

what the feedback is

what the possible resolutions are what

the what the routing will be so the

routing is not always discrete you can't

say or predefined that we will always go

down this route it really depends on

feedback information and all of that

that will determine the next step so

that is a case style approach um add-up

data entry uh one of the custom

customers

that we have is a large um

funeral home service

and i have

they receive a broad range of

of data

as part of the onboarding process

information can come

in in

an unstructured way to them so there's

different information around who's going

to pay the bill there's different

arrange information around actual

funeral

arrangement there's different

information around

the deceased details

there's a whole lot of different type of

data and we can't dictate the fashion or

the sequence that we got that we are

actually going to

get that in information so that is also

a case style so at any point in time we

can jump around

and add information to that the other

one

is is social listening so an example of

that is we take we monitor twitter feeds

or something like that

for reputation management and we

and based on that depending on what the

twitter feed actually says someone needs

to read it and then based on that it

needs to be routed by

for action to to to the appropriate

place and that is also an unstructured

process because it's really dependent on

what the information also what the what

the initial

message was and how we take it through

the resolution process even inside that

resolution process there's multiple

options depending on what the outcomes

are so this is those are typical

unstructured processes that we find

ourselves working in

if we look at a quick example of

what we call a

unstructured process in version 6

i'm just going to hand over the

keyboard here quickly to

gavin he's got the software and i'll be

talking on that so i just want to pass

it on to him

okay

double check that we can see

the right screen great

so as you can see

in order to explain what unstructured

processes look like and i just quickly

want to touch on what a structured

process

typically looks like so

what we've got on the screen is our xm

pro

xm designer so this is where we build

processes and at the back you can see

there's a

physio based diagram and that diagram

has got structured custom onboarding so

you can see there's a discrete flow and

there's a specific path or routing

um

that it

has to step through

those are about those only 20 of

processes that we have in our in in

organization if we look at a typical

unstructured process so the previous one

was customer onboarding and we took a

very structured flow very basic

in this instance what we're looking at

is unstructured of what we call

opportunity management so for example we

so we

we

respond to tenders rfps rfcs all of

those sort of things rfqs

so we we respond to uh to those and we

see those all as opportunities so this

is a sales based process and what you'll

see there's a whole bunch of events now

from x and pro point of view

we now refer to to this canvas that you

see as our process container and we can

add events to that so there's a whole

bunch of events

that we can that we can add

those events are

typically a process starts with

something like start opportunity but

then there's a whole bunch of events we

consider bid committees there's

technical reviews there's actual

proposal presentation there's project

costing there's conducting credit checks

there's

margin approvals also all sorts of

things right now the credit check

uh is is at the end of the process uh

what what gavin's going to do he's just

going to move it

so as you'll see right now

credit check is just one of those

options that will come through

that you can

as part of

the later stages of the actual

process what we're going to do is we're

actually going to

include so we would like to dynamically

to the start process we would

dynamically like to add he's using our

dynamic allocation logic which we call

dull

and

without

drawing flow diagrams or anything like

that you'll see

so as you can see um the credit check

just still sits there as an event

and but if you refresh this you'll see

on the right hand side we now have

credit check

as an option uh without so we've not had

to do any workflow coding or set up a a

specific code for that so this is

opportunity management and in this

in this instance

i'm just going to put in a abn number

there in any number

now there's a couple of business rules

behind this thing that says if it's a

new customer

and it's a new segment and it's new

technology and the value is more than

something then it will always have to go

to a big committee it can't be done by

the salespersons

um

you'll see right there it's now it's it

doesn't mean that it has to go to the

bid committee right now you can set it

to do that it just means before this

process will be completed it will have

to be seen by a bit committee if we

change some of the other parameters so

we make the value less and we also say

it's not a new technology and it's not a

new customer

in this instance you will see that i

just make that a

lesser amount what you'll see is that

it's not a that

contributor what the threshold was

that we said in here as you can see the

threshold is probably about five

thousand dollars

um so everything about five thousand

dollars will have to go to a bid

committee it's going to put in some

comments there

so

so on the right hand side the action

items that those are actually

the um

the the the dynamic

buttons that that exam in xm pro version

six what that allows you to do is

dynamically have as many buttons as you

need for a unstructured process so i can

if it's a structured process it'll only

have one button and you can only go one

or two routes if it's dynamic with that

dynamic allocation logic we can actually

expose all of those

elements that were shown on the flow

diagram you can actually expose all of

them what gavin's doing now is just he's

just adding some documents to this so

there's some opportunity documents that

came in with that

so what he's going to do now is actually

send it off

for a credit check because he has

contextual information he knows that he

read something in the paper about this

airline the blue bean airline or

whatever

the um

so

he's now going on to um

logging in as mark smith who is the

financial

controller who actually does the

credit check

so in his to-do list

and the case

he's got a task and in that task

in terms of function as standard process

functionality we're not covering

any of that in this webinar if you want

to understand how the routing the the

options the audit trials the integration

all of that works

then please contact us or one of our

partners and we can demonstrate that to

you so what kevin's doing here let me

just kevin just go back to the top of

the screen so we can just explain

um

i just want to explain um this is the

credit check forms in that it's brought

in information from the previous

screen

there we've got a web service that does

a

a currency conversion before we actually

submit this to dun and bradstreet we

want to so this web service goes off and

uses a web-based service and right now

as of today we're getting 92 australian

cents for one us dollar

which is not great for us exporting from

australia

and so instead the two thousand dollars

from our credit point of view

is now only

1800 that needs to be

approved on on our side what you'll see

is because we've not reviewed it that

button shows not reviewed so i can

submit this and it'll it'll it will

trigger a different

review process if i want if i do the

credit check right now so what it'll do

if you use the web service go to dun and

bradstreet come back give it a credit

score and you'll see in terms of our

business rules this is now a positive

review so that dynamically changes

if you open the case file the documents

that were associated in the previous

steps are all there so you can see the

documents that are now that can be

sharepoint based or they can be

file-based

so that's all stored in there

the positive

review

sort of leads me into all the the change

of the button to positive review

actually leads me into

into the next

component of

what x and pro does if we look at

dynamic processes so as you saw that

button dynamically changed so based on

the context or conditions that button

actually changed so what does dynamic

mean well by dynamic when we say that

that's rules based event driven actions

the example that you saw with a vizio

diagram with all those activities that

were not linked those are all events

that all discrete events each of those

events have their own screen they have

their own data integration they have

their own rules

and we can dynamic or

we can dynamically or

in an unstructured way sequence them

when we need them

a key another key part of it is that

these dynamic

processes

utilize things like predictive analytics

process mining and business intelligence

to make it more goal oriented so

essentially what it does

it provides

agile flexible processes that are still

managed by a set of rules so this is

more a rules-based or

rule engine approach with a whole bunch

of events that can occur

so we still work within rules it's not

just anyone do what they want

especially when you look at compliance

governance those sort of things and so

this rules framework that can

dynamically adjust

uh based on the events of the of the

context of the process like you saw when

we did the credit check

it immediately came back with the credit

score and based on the credit score the

button uh changed and it it actually now

goes down a route for where there was a

positive

approval the other

the other element um which we will

demonstrate uh when we show you some

dynamic processes is the ability to

advise next best action using data

mining and predictive analytics all that

that means is we can go and look at the

historical

or previous processes and say what did

someone do with the same set of

conditions when they had the same set of

conditions

what what was the

what actions were taken at that point in

time so it gives you guidance

and i need to stress it's guidance it

doesn't take over the workflow it

doesn't change the you still have the

ability to make the decision

and that is a key element of of a

of

intelligent business operations you

provide the intelligence to people but

you still rely on them to make those

decisions you have the order trials so

you can see what decisions were made and

that is actually what we use those we

can mine that data and we can actually

use that as part of

of

the ability to advise next best actions

you can also visualize process goals at

each step to guide the work decisions

now those process goals can either be in

the transaction or they can be

overarching for the overall process so

these are kpis every process should have

a kpi it doesn't matter what you do even

if you're doing remuneration

adjustments across the organization you

need there are certain kpis that need to

be um adhered to whether you

um whether it's sales whether it's

procurement whether it's operations it

doesn't matter processes and the best

way of looking at that is actually if

you look at a balanced scorecard balance

scorecard is built all around kpis

it's all around the strategy of the

organization so

that is typically something we would

that we would like to show people

when they are at a work step we don't

want them to go to a analytics dashboard

we want to embed some of those analytics

widgets into the actual process so that

they can see

what it is or what the current context

is and they can make better business

decisions

so when we look at

dynamic processes

they can dynamically change based on

events as i as i described

they are also context aware so it means

if there's a change

in

either internal environment or external

environment that you can manage it and

it's got built-in predictive analytics

so if we look at dynamically what do we

mean by dynamically change on events i

want to give you some examples so for

example we have data rules so it can it

can change based on certain data rules

so we can check

how are we doing against a budget and

when we get to 80 of

of our budget we can introduce

additional approvals or something like

that or on a sales budget as soon as we

hit break even point we we don't allow

discounts anymore um then we want to

maximize profit so the initial part is

is

around budget is actually to get a

just to make our number from a

break-even point of view and then we

want to change the rules and then we

want to maximize profit so that is one

way that a process can change if you

look at

there can be business rules an example

of that is a complex approval matrix

if you've got a

for example a banking client with a

complex approval structure for

procurement where they have 10 or 20 000

people that do procurement and they have

all these hr categories where people fit

in a and b and c and whatever and you

may require that two a's and a b sign

for a specific gl account that's quite a

complex approval matrix the challenge

that you have

and most of this can can be done

um

with with with some basic workflows the

challenge that you have is as soon as

if that complex approval matrix changes

every month like it does in a bank you

have people that move around leave and

new people that join so that whole

complex approval matrix

and with all the emerges and

acquisitions and putting departments

together and taking them apart we have

found that that is a really really hard

thing to manage

if you if you can't dynamically change

the process is based on on that so

that's one example where business rules

have an impact on how you dynamically

want to change it and then

lastly you want to use

social events to be able to change

processes and dynamically or escalate or

drive it to a different user so for

example if i was the insurance company

and i

on twitter put

carjacked help

i was hoping that someone would pick it

up and action it

so and i and based on the fact that it

is a distress word

um it will actually um elevate it other

than just saying xyz insurance companies

suck which is a different problem uh

from a from a social event so yeah

there's a whole number of ways that you

can actually dynamically change

processes

so that just means if you combine that

with unstructured unstructured it says

we don't have to follow a specific path

dynamics says based on context based on

things that i know

we will actually change so when we look

at context

so what happens if the exchange rate

changes you may want to as soon as

there's a exchange rate change you may

want to enforce a whole different set of

rules

and routing and logic

on

on your procurement sales or whatever

the processes are that are all impacted

by exchange rate changes

one one example is safer and and this

was one that i read um i store

storm impact on insurance call center as

soon as there's a big storm what you

want to do is you want to reduce or you

want to streamline that

that process of getting claims through

by just taking out a whole lot of

approvals and and and

complexity in in the process you still

want to have some controls but you just

want to get that call center going

without back without a big backlog

building up in it and then the other the

other context aware thing is so who's

doing the transaction if it's the md of

the organization it may have a

completely different route logic

business rules and everything so it

needs to be context aware around who the

person is that's actually doing the

transaction and based on that it will

prescribe certain rules flows

and even data that it may or may not

show them so that is typically what i

what what

context aware means when we look at

built-in pre predictive analytics it's

really

taking the investment that we've done in

our bi and putting that into the process

why look at bi separately

sort of a rear view mirror approach

and not put it into the actual processor

when someone's doing something for

example on my on my and this is the

example we're quickly going to show you

is when i do a approval for a

for for purchasing i can actually put

the graph out of sap or oracle or

ax or whatever financial system it is

that you use

we can actually put that graph into the

process so you you know immediately

whether you can approve it or not

you can add additional approval steps on

a threshold so what we so so

when that graph approaches 80 of

our budget we can introduce additional

rules or change rules based on that and

we can advise next best actions based on

this

predictive

analytics

this example in actual fact i think one

of the guys on the webinar at the moment

actually works on that

project where from a university

perspective they they get paid based on

grants

um

so they get grants based on students

that finish and one of the things that

you want to do that you want to predict

or want to find is actually students

that fall off

or that are showing signs of not

completing courses so you want to look

at and there's such such amount of data

as i said right at the start people are

actually overwhelmed by data so what you

want to do is is take the attendance

records the library records the

canteen records and all of those collate

that information and try and identify

those students that are that are that

are

showing

signs of of of that they will

potentially drop off then you can action

that and start processes to actively try

and engage them in in in the process of

um

getting them back in so that you can um

get your your your grants at the end of

the day the one challenge that you have

with that at some point in time the cost

of trying to get that student back

actually crosses over with the value of

money that you're going to get so from a

business point of view on your dashboard

you'd like to see when do we stop doing

this it's a great approach so it uses a

lot of

all this predictive

analytics and it can put it into the

process we can drive the process we can

try and get them

through consultation and whatever

mechanisms they use but at some point in

time we also need to say well this is

not not worth it so that is typically

applications

for this there are some questions coming

through for the webinar i'll answer them

at the end

so let's give you an example of a

dynamic process

in version 6 of ibos

and i'm just going to once again hand

over to gavin

and make him the presenter so he's got a

keyboard and mouse so as i was saying we

have a purchase

a purchase requisition process so you

can see there's actually three ones open

that's um he's logged in as tim clark

and them as

has got three you chose the first one

which was keith miller so if you look at

the history

you will see that keith was looking to

buy so as you can see xmp pro puts the

previous steps in line so the form so

you can actually see what was ordered

for 9 000

for a server rack

so we can just close the history

and there's a whole other functionality

and once again we can demonstrate that

to you if you're interested in a a

separate

presentation so what you'll see the

graph that has come through actually

draws the data from the financial system

so the erp or whatever you're using and

there's a budget of 22 000 we've spent

12 000 up to now there's another 2 000

currently committed in another

transaction sitting somewhere in the

approval stage and in this one you'll

see the requisition total corresponds

with the

graph element over there so based on

this

i can see that i will probably there's a

good chance of me approving this but i

would actually like to understand how am

i doing

but on my overall

experience management so

if i look at my process goal so the firs

the bottom

graph the budget goal is for that

specific activity for that specific

event that we're doing

the top one is my process goals so that

will stretch over all

for that whole transaction every single

time

you do an event that that graph will

show so in this instance we can see and

you can customize these graphs in the

back end of of x and pro

our designer we have a chart wizard you

build these um drag and drop with fancy

graphics so you don't have to worry

about to do that you know that's the

fact you can embed the widgets

from some of the the bi tools out there

you can actually embed those widgets in

there as well to give you that

information

but in this instance we can see that

we're currently spending in our our

budget is twenty two thousand dollars

sorry um

the budget is seventeen thousand dollars

uh

on that oh sorry thousand

seventeen thousand dollars and you can

see our monthly expenditure so i can see

right now for the last three months i

haven't really spent as much as i

as i have previously and i can also see

by department in terms of the three gl

codes that i am responsible for for

approvals i can see

my id expenditure at the moment is the

highest on hr spend the low so those are

kpis or process goals that i can now use

to drive

this process just one more thing that i

want to do i want to see what did other

people do when they were in a similar

position so i can look at the next best

action and what the next best action

does you can put

the checkbox anywhere that you want

but what you can do with the next best

action it will actually say out of the

previous 200 um

200 uh instances of a similar condition

same gel code or whatever the case might

be

what did most people do so based on that

i can see that a good 70 of the time

people actually approved it based on the

current conditions that we have right

now so you can use predictive analytics

to to to drive that um

uh uh

what what it is that

that you're actually going to do so that

gives you sort of a view of what a

a

dynamic process can look like obviously

you saw the the button changing

previously you can add additional

buttons as it goes

but what is really powerful is being

able to advise

and use

the the

predictive approach

and using

the business intelligence that we have

and also visualizing the process goals

and it's all around making better

business decisions with all of this

information we're not taking the ability

away from people to do to make a

decision we just give them as much

information as they need to actually

make good decisions

the last element

that i'd like to

talk about

is

social processes so as you'll recall we

had unstructured processes we had

dynamic processes and lastly what makes

intelligent business operations is

actually to take some of the

conversations

that we have in and around business and

it's

and

so to take the social conversations that

are in

or around the business and its

transactions what we mean by that

is sometimes we want to talk about

process improvement

for example other instances we want to

talk about a specific transaction

and we want to capture all of that

information

the other thing that we want to do is um

we want to be around the business so

when we're in the business we

or in the process itself it is all

around

what happens inside that process or the

transaction

around the business is by monitoring

social channels like what are people

saying on facebook twitter all of those

and turn those tweets into tasks there's

a separate webinar that we did

previously that goes into a lot of

detail showing exactly how the social

listener works and how you do reputation

management with that we also have some

great information coming up

around reputation management and how you

can do it for your organization

but

but right now i'm just going to show you

a very basic example of that what you

also want to do is and and that is so

critical is actually to capture the

social collaboration as part of the

order trial or the decision trail

you don't just want the emails flying

around the processes on the outside you

actually want those social

collaborations to be part of the order

trial so you want to be able to see

what was said why did we approve it

that we couldn't find in the previous

workflow based

approach so let's show you example of

that collaboration in

version six

quickly going to

and once again um

i've got gavin showing uh so i'm not

logged in as as um

as keith miller uh and what he is going

to do is under policy so in this

instance there was a policy control

sorry a policy change process someone

wanted to change

a policy and as part of that so you can

see in the in the history

of that you can see the history and time

and date stamp so this is the standard

history and

you can drag and drop and sort by people

so even with large volumes of

information it's quite easy to find

transactions

what you can see the icon the actual

icons differ so those are traditional

events or activity steps or process

steps and the one with the little orange

components are two people collaborating

and in this instance you'll see so we

had a we had a complete new policy

proposal form then coordinate the policy

proposal and then afterwards

in that step um

tim actually started

sorry keith actually went back and said

tim there's stuff that we need to do now

as you can see this is unstructured um

so these are conversations that become

part of the transaction so the so

when i look at the order trial of the

process

i can actually see the collaboration

around discussions that also was part of

this whole this this whole

approach so it's really a very powerful

way of capturing those

those social interactions and there's

even time and date stamps and all of

those go into the

full order trial so there's full time

and date stamps what is nice about this

is we can put some bi over this

and start looking at who are the social

collaborators should we actually include

them in the formal process or not

um and those are really business

decisions there's some uh

the

social

collaboration aspect

people can either be decisions sorry

they can be influencers

by by providing information or they can

be silent approvers you want to you want

to use your bi tools and actually go and

have a look at that

the other thing that you can do with bi

on unstructured processes while gavin's

opening this up what you can do with bi

on unstructured processes is actually

look at what is the real path that

people follow not the path that we

thought they followed but that's great

that's the other great thing with bi on

top of unstructured processes lastly i

just want to touch on

so

we have a twitter feed and that twitter

feed um picked up

example as a tag

um so with our social listener some

manthan said uh

said something he's watching the the the

webinar now what you want to do with

those you want to turn to tasks into

tweets now once again this is dynamic

and unstructured so depending on what he

wrote we

might want to send it either to customer

service to bookings to other bookings

was actually example that we used with

um with qanas so

depending on what it is that

that is saying we actually have a whole

bunch of

possible actions that can come out of

this and we can drive that dynamically

so we can listen

socially

as well

and then lastly i just want to want him

to log out as you'll see from a social

perspective xm pro version 6 has also

introduced the ability to log in using

facebook

you can use your gmail account your

windows live account linkedin twitter

yahoo and also other business

proprietary ones like sap

so we from a social perspective

processes are not limited to the

enterprise anymore it's on facebook as

well so

we'll be showing you our facebook app in

the not do to this in the future and

also show you how

you can actually run processes inside

the social world of facebook

just going to grab the screen back from

gavin

so

what we've shown you with version 6 is

that we can make better business

decisions

because we have context-based

information it can change dynamically we

show all this information on the screen

so we show all the business intelligence

predictive analytics all of that on the

screen that helps people to make better

business decisions which is a key a key

challenge for business right now it

empowers these knowledge workers to do

what they know best but still within a

governance framework that suits us

and it makes these business intelligence

insights actionable a lot of people have

spent a lot of money on bi and now we

take those things that you learn out of

that and actually turn those into

actions and it improves collaboration by

harnessing the social interaction that

means

uh we can capture those conversations

that we have

it's all about it's better business

outcomes so we can manage our kpis

xm pro version 6 gives you better

control of knowledge work

so you've got older trials of that it's

a better experience for the knowledge

workers because we're not forcing

forcing them down a specific route we

we empower them to still make

intelligent business decisions and in

the end this all means a lower cost of

business operations

thank you very much i see there's a

couple of questions

i'll just address this um

there's a question around if the input

from one business process is required as

input to another process how is this

supported in an unstructured process or

is this by definition what it

that that it is a structured sequential

process if the information um thanks

it's a great question if the information

from one process from one activity is

required in the other um it is quite it

you can still do that in a in a in a

dynamic way so

you can i'm trying to think how to

explain this from my

and not having the software open in

front of me to to do that

xmpro has the ability that you can

interrogate any previous activity from a

from the one that you're in right now to

interrogate what information it contains

at that point in time so even though i

can write it unstructured when this

event that i'm in right now requires

information that was captured in a

previous event i can interrogate that

previous

previous event from this one

so

it does not imply that it's a that it's

a structured sequential process

but you also need to look at this from a

practical point of view when you design

processes to say well if i'm going to

have an event that is that requires

information from my previous event

then i will need to make sure that the

previous event happened in the

prior to the one that i'm in right now

uh it may not be in a structured way you

may still have you still might do it in

a in an unstructured way so there there

may be multiple options of getting to

the one to the activity where i am right

now but if it does require information

um then

then you will just need to make sure

from a logical approach that that

initial one um

occurred i hope that answers your

question if not we can we can actually

show you um how it works what you'll

find with a lot of processes

is actually that there's a hybrid model

so the 80 20 as i said right at the

start twenty percent of the process of a

process twenty percent happens at the

start

which is the sort of the structured

let's log a request do a requisition do

something like that and then it goes

into the eighty percent of well let

someone decide what the next action is

and then it may actually go back into a

structured process in the end so

that in itself because it becomes a

hybrid is a is a by definition by

definition and unstructured process even

though it has

structured elements built into it so

that's one way of

doing it

sequential processes are something where

you redefine all the steps

and you actually draw a flow

in a

unstructured process you can still have

rules that determine sequencing but but

it but it means

but you don't have to draw the error so

i hope that that answers

your question if there are any more

questions um please

feel free to contact myself

or any one of our partners and we'd be

happy to show you how we do this

thank you for your time
