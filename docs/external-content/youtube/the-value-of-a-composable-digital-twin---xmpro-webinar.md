XMPRO’s Event Intelligen...
good morning good afternoon or good

evening

wherever you are joining us from and

welcome to this webinar on the value of

a composable digital twin

i'm peter von sculpek and i've been

around this space for a while

i am the ceo of xm pro and probably the

chief

technology enthusiast in the

organization

i'm also the chair for the natural

resources working group

in the digital twin consortium and prior

to that

i was the chair for the digital twin

interoperability task group in the

industrial internet consortium

now you'll probably agree with me that

2020

will certainly go down in history as one

of the most

disruptive uncertain and transformative

years for

both organizations and people in those

organizations worldwide

was one of my one of my learned friends

explained it to me said overnight it

exposed the systemic fragility in the

operating capabilities of enterprises

and organizations that's quite a

mouthful

but it really just means there were a

lot of challenges a lot of confusion

and many many organizations and people

struggle to deal with

the impact of what we saw in 2020

i think you'll also agree with me that

we've seen unprecedented acceleration of

digital

technology adoption and we've also seen

a lot of behavioural transformation

again within

organizations and businesses but also in

people

in those organizations and businesses

throughout this pandemic

we've seen five years of digital

transformation happen

in less than five months and that's

according to a number of industry

analysts

the future reality is that the rate of

change will probably only increase

professor peter frisk who consults to

large organizations as well as

governments and he specializes in what

is called innovative

business futures says that we will

probably see

more change the next 10 years than what

we've seen in the last 250.

now that is really exciting but it's

also really scary

what is even more sobering is the fact

that the future change

that peter frisk was talking about is

actually here right now

so right now we see long-term planning

visions from

organizations like gartner extend to six

to eight years which is really just

around the corner in business

and it should already be on your

strategic planning horizon

everything else is shorter term as you

can see here and these are

significant emerging technologies that

will that will change how we work

the impact of everything else that that

is on here is already here

and it should already be in your

short-term plans

the challenge that many organizations

face is that the traditional business

models were designed when computerized

business was still in its infancy it was

seen as a department that supplied the

computers the servers the

the the the it nerds that help you when

you got stuck on your

on your notebook or or um

on if the printer didn't work and

the the reality is that

even though it improved business

efficiency

it was never the platform for business

and business users uh were

were and are frustrated with digital

transformation plans

that are using that are more about

digitizing so getting things into

digital format and getting it onto ipads

and tablets and mobiles

so just digitizing rather than changing

business models

to be able to to and use it to drive and

be the platform

for this transformational change

what we also see is that um

the it's not just internal but

externally there's a lot of pressure on

on organizations

and uh we have less time to respond

companies don't last that long anymore

and the risk of a rigid

inflexible business is really that you

will be extinct lifespan have gone from

75 years in 1950

to just 15 years in 2020

and the other sobering statistic is that

52 percent

of um fortune 500 companies

um in that were in in the

in 2000 are not around in 2020

so if you think about how blockbuster

got

netflixed uh that is what happened to a

lot

what's happening to a lot of

organizations and uh

what i'm thinking um about quite often

is what will the average lifespan be

in 2040 now

we also come from a kind of past three

decades where everything was dominated

by large-scale monolithic

technology platforms such as erps

and crms and it was all about stability

efficiency

driving process efficiency optimization

and again it was mostly focused around

improving efficiencies

in processes the problem going forward

or the challenge going forward is that

these systems are typically very rigid

and don't support the pace of change

that we see

it may have worked for the change in the

last 250 years but it certainly

doesn't support the agility innovation

and experimentation that is needed

uh going into the future uh this is a

quote

from gartner on on on on

the the um enterprise architecture

models that are needed for the future

and

according to them developing a software

engineering strategy that is fit for

for the future is a huge struggle as

business landscapes are constantly

shifting and user demands

are increasing exponentially application

leaders

should demand adherence to composable

enterprise architecture

in their business applications now this

is just one quote

from from gartner organization we see

that in best of class businesses doing

this what you'll find

is or you may find yourself in knee-deep

in

in these challenges as i mentioned

before and typically we

we see two two approaches to to

to addressing this the one is how do we

fix the problem how how do i become the

the fixer and this is where uh

the digital transformation and digital

technologies

can support going through a approach

as was mentioned on the on the previous

slide of composable applications it

gives us the ability to

to fix and change as we go but we also

have the fissures so we have the fixers

and the fishes the fishes are

are really where business can exploit

these opportunities that are this how do

we fish while this is happening while

we're fixing on the

on the other end because this will be a

continuous way

of of of things happening going forward

and

in actual fact we've seen massive floods

in australia where i'm doing this from

um at the moment

uh over the last couple of weeks where

a year ago it was it was massive fires

we then had

all bushfires we then had um covered and

now we've got

flood so so um the environment is

definitely a lot more fluid things

happen quickly and how do we fish while

that has happened how do we make our

business agile

managing this or doing this actually

requires three key business changes and

the first one

is um that there's a certain

that that you need to be able to use a

modular approach for applications that

can be composed or recomposed on demand

so you need to have that ability to

respond quickly

the next part is that business and

technology

should be closer aligned and it should

be focused on how do we enable business

experts those that can fish

to support them to be able to do it

quicker and faster

and in the past the the systems that we

had

was not really designed for this it was

not

enabling business users uh from us

to to make themselves sufficient um it's

the the third part is around uh

traditional

solutions um reduce the capability for

fast

decision making to make the best

decisions quickly

and being contextualized and informed

and that's really what what the business

users need in order to drive um

or to be able to adapt at the pace that

we that we see

and for that the best way of approaching

this is to create a composable reusable

approach which gartner refers to as

intelligent composable business

applications different analysts call

them different names essentially the

same

the same background or the same thing so

before we look at composable digital

twins let's have a quick look at what a

composable business application is

i'm using the gartner example here but

they are

this is actually based on or it has its

roots in

in sower and microservices and it's it's

being adopted by best in class

organizations in different

ways it is also

[Music]

it starts with using traditional legacy

and business applications as we know

creating a data fabric that sits at the

bottom to support this but then building

these

packaged business capabilities pbcs

package business capabilities around

certain areas how do we compose how do

we put some of these capabilities

together

at this level and then have a

composition platform where we can string

some of these together compose with them

and those platforms typically handle the

integration composition

orchestration development as well as the

front end for it

so that users can create these specific

composed applications you can think of

using a the capabilities that's within

the erp or crm for many organizations

they only used a good 20 another 30

percent might be

used a lot less frequently and

50 of the functionality actually never

gets used

the objective with package business

applications is to to or

business capabilities is to actually

take

the key capabilities that you need and

be able to compose

highly relevant and reusable

and agile applications very quickly

an example of this before we get into

twins i thought i'd just share an

example of

analytics package business

capability and in this instance you'll

see

we take um capabilities like reporting

and package that as well as

uh uh um self-service analytics

predictive modeling

and all of these are what is what

what are what is referred to as the

specific

capabilities that are then packaged

together and what makes a package

business capability

in terms of characteristic it and it's

it's not about the technology but it's

about the

the capability so it's not looking at

what is what is

the underlying technology behind this

but what is the business capability that

i need in order to address a specific

business challenge

so these package business applications

are almost encapsulated software

components that

that describe a well-defined business

capability and it can be recognized by a

business user so something like a

leak detection model from a prediction

point of view that is a classic

package business capability

well-designed

package business capability are

typically modular so

they consist in a modular fashion and

you can

they're also autonomous so typically

self-sufficient

and they would stand on their own and

i'll show you some examples

at the end of the presentation of how

or what some of these look like also

orchestrated

so you can compose them and put them in

different sequences to address a

specific so you can assemble the process

flows or the or the

or the transactions through these apis

so that they are they are basically

packaged for composition

and then they are easily discoverable so

someone who's a business user again

would

very easily recognize that capability

without necessarily understanding all

the underlying technology that sits with

that

now this doesn't only apply to analytics

it also

applies to other areas in the business

and kind of this example

just shows where we can start with an

application like a patient

oh sorry application public package

business capability where we have

patient patient records and everything

that's said around that we may then have

a digital twin component which might be

an infection detector

the analytics component would handle

infection rate

predictions and then also on the data

side we might be building a data

repository of

some information that we want to do in

terms of infection

incidents or whatever the case might be

so this just shows you

how these work together it's not a

single type we actually compose an

application by using some application

digital twin

analytics and um other data

or or other package business

applications together

it's a it's kind of like

the lego bricks that kids use to build

or create

their own compositions which is only

limited by the imagination

the range of modular bricks enable the

kids to

for example create motion experience by

just packaging the wheels and it's

probably already got the battery and the

motor and everything packaged in this i

can clip this in

within a matter of seconds to create

that capability of

motion in this application that i have

here

um the other benefit is i can i can now

build it

the way that the manufacturer describes

it on the box or i can

adapt it and change the sequence of

things so that i have my own creation in

actual fact

um they can create their own

or i can use the same box of

capabilities and build a four by four

vehicle um

in in this example instead of having the

formula one racing car

reuse many of these components and build

a completely different

use case or application using many of

the same composable i may need a few

extra blocks that are not around here

like the bull bar or some

or one of the others and i may leave out

one or two

of these but in essence i can reuse or

recompose

very quickly based on the changing

environment

that i have when we now

and understanding what what composable

business

applications um uh give us

or uh and the package business

capabilities

that that exist within them we can also

look at

how this now starts applying to digital

twins so

as you can see on the digital twin we

have the physical side of things as well

as the digital and as we start packaging

these capabilities like

location scheduling leak detection these

are all package business capabilities

that make it really

easy to to create

new or to make our digital twin

applications address

very specific business cases now one of

the challenges that we sit with

um when we look at digital twins is

is that there's even more complexity

than what we see with

traditional erp or crm uh challenges the

other the good news though is that it

also naturally lends itself to

composability

and i i honestly believe that it's the

only way to build scalable digital twins

is to make them composable

otherwise you will remain stuck with a

few discrete

twins in pilot projects so you may end

up with a few

um sample ones in pilot projects or the

the dreaded pilot purgatory where um

this actually never move beyond that

stage because it's not composable i

can't take the spot plug it into

a assembly so going from a gearbox into

a ball mill on a mining plant

and then taking that mining plant

actually making part of the

the overall

processing plant for the for for the

mine or a factory or

or a a a power plant or whatever the

application

for this so the challenge with digital

twins is it is

it it requires this a capability of

compa

of being able to be composed so going

from a single node

a single entity into a assembly and that

assembly actually then getting into a

system

of of uh assembled components again

it lends itself naturally but also if

you don't have the if you don't keep

this composable approach in mind

you will probably get stuck by not

moving beyond this capability

over here and the reality that we also

see

is that um and again looking at

some of the stats coming out of analysts

is that

for larger organizations we'll probably

see them managing a thousand digital

twin templates

and a million digital twin instances by

2025 and this is pretty recent research

as well so

again the scale at which this needs to

be done the only way that you

couldn't do this there's no other way to

manage scalability

and quick time to value if you don't

have a composable

architecture so it is not just about the

single entity but it's about the whole

ecosystem the whole environment and how

it all fits together and this all needs

to be composable as this

use case may change this environment

around it will need that same

flexibility and ability

to change now

this is all well and great but we need

to be able to explain what the value of

all of this is

in monetary terms so when we go to

stakeholders and budget holders and get

money for these projects

we need to be able to explain the value

of these and the simplest way that i

found is using the world economic

forum's

total value at stake model and in that

model

kind of two dimensions which is what is

um for the industry or the your specific

business

and what is the other one what is the

value for the largest society

or society at large and the first one

is really around value migration so

being able to

create new business models do that

digital transformation and get new

revenue from new digital services that

we didn't have in the past

and also creating marketplaces for these

composed capabilities and how do we

market and sell those

to be able to make it easier for others

then there's the traditional approach

from a

what value do we add by just increasing

what we're already doing so how do we

how do we

exploit and move faster around current

short-term opportunities

but also how do we eliminate costs so

how do we make our plans

how do we improve the reliability

reliability

availability and all of those metrics

that we do right now but how can we do

it quicker

faster and and respond to the changes

uh much quicker then from a

valued stake for society point of view

the impact of this

the the savings that come with it but

also you know what is the impact of

being able to make better decisions

faster and that whole agility around

decision support with

com with a composable digital to an

approach

now as i mentioned at the start the

focus is really how can we get business

experts to be able to fish how do we get

how do we train or bring new skills to

to

subject matter eggs to experts to be

able to compose these digital twins

themselves what is the value in

being able to do that and then obviously

the the broader impact is making sure

that we have safer work environments

especially in the asset intensive

industries where we operate

and then lastly in terms of the impact

on the environment reducing emissions

and

all the sustainability metrics that we

can do and respond again

pretty quick on that a lot of

organizations are putting out

20 30 goals in terms of their

sustainability goals

it's not that far away so you really

need to make sure

that you have that you have that ability

to compose

the

green elements into the current digital

twins

and and package that capability and and

make it scalable

the the other benefit of a um composable

digital twin approach is that you can

basically build

the twins from the bottom up and you can

see immediate returns we often see that

companies start with these large-scale

projects that want to

address these really big large complex

problems now quite often

the result of that is that the project

team has moved on three years later

there's been no returns a composable

approach

actually help you to start it's a fast

affordable and easy to wait

easy to use way to start building up

from the bottom up

and actually get quick returns which

fund the larger projects so for example

in a

mid-sized organization if you've got 25

engineers and each of them

build 20 composed digital twins or

applications and each of those have an

impact

of of two million dollars you very

quickly get to an

overall impact of one billion dollars

which is

very possible and we've seen that with

our customers in terms of being able to

deliver that

then once you've got that better done

you've got the skills and you've

you've built enough packaged business

capabilities

in all these individual ones and reuse

them to start expanding

to more complex and advanced ones

um where we can now address some of

these bigger challenges in the

organization so first do the easy ones

before we get to some of the big bets

it's one of the really big benefits of

using a composable

architecture so how does this all apply

to digital twins

now from a

a model approach it's nothing other than

apis and integration as we know it but

what's fundamentally different is how

this is packaged together in terms of

of of standalone units that can then be

composed and the key aspect here is that

there's a composition environment that

allows me to to be able to put all of

this together so i can

compose my twins in an environment and

they are done in such a way the wrappers

around the apis are done in such a way

that it makes it a lot easier

to compose and almost visually program

this

one of the the the

things that we see with digital twins

and it's also covered in the ultimate

guide to digital twins um that's on our

website

um is kind of the data models and the

data sources that we see

in digital twins are pretty well

understood and defined so

um and these are the six characteristics

i'm not going to go through all of them

right now you can you can have a look

um on our website um and get access to

the ultimate guide to digital twins

where we go into

more detail on this but from a digital

twin perspective these are the key data

areas or data sources now what we want

to do with that is actually put it

into a framework similar to what

what we saw earlier around the

composable business applications but

make it very specific to composable

digital twins

and then use this the data fabric that

sits at the bottom

use this as a key element of that

and provide these services so we can

compose and package some of these things

together

still using our legacy ot and

engineering applications

and also the business and it

applications plug into them

bring it in either at the platform level

or at the data fabric level

but really creating these these

um packaged business capabilities that

address very specific elements

in it and through that we can compose

applications like

for example intelligent building energy

optimization or

blast furnace casting guidance or first

pass

yield in a in a production manufacturing

environment or

tailings and environmental monitoring in

mining and some of the other extractive

industries so these were the these are

the composed

applications they're kind of micro apps

in the business it

addresses a very specific business

challenge and i can very quickly change

these and make them adaptable

to changing environments

to by by just reusing the capabilities

that are packaged

in here and the way that we do that in

example is

on the one hand with our data stream so

at the integration level

and being able to bring in to integrate

compose and orchestrate is a key element

of of this

and having package business capabilities

here and and and being able to drag it

on

and on the other hand being able to

create the ux and

an environment in a similar way where

we've packaged capabilities that sit

around this

to be able to do just that again taking

these package business capabilities

um and and integrated there now some of

the examples and we'll run you through

this in a practical example um

on us on our software just to

demonstrate that but

some of our package business

capabilities as you can see here

there's quite a range of them where i

don't have to understand how to

i don't have to rewrite the code to

to be able to connect or for example an

azure smart contract i don't know i can

just

literally drag that capability onto the

canvas

and put it and wire it up with the rest

of my

and compose and integrate and

orchestrate rather than write all the

code that sits behind that so

being able to compose and reuse

capabilities like that

makes it very powerful and very quick to

adapt

when we need to make changes to our

system

then on the ux side very similar so if i

want something in unity i can just drag

the unity component on and just wire it

to the data

and the model so that i can reuse this

capability

or being able to compose very quickly

using this package business capability

before we go into the software and i

show you some examples

i just also like to put out a word of

caution in terms of

package business capabilities

be careful that it's not like the

the wall socket and plug situation that

we see

across the world where it may work in

your own environment but doesn't work

anywhere else you need to be able to

make sure that these things can also

connect

across different systems so

it doesn't help that it only works in

one area so when you look at a package

business capability it needs to be

extensible across

in different applications the way that

we do that

um and again i honestly believe this is

the only way to respond

um and scale to the

to the more complex challenges um

is with a composable digital to an

approach and

the first step is to do the inter is at

the integration

uh layer where we have package

capabilities so be able to compose data

streams using these package capabilities

and then integrate

data sources to that the second step is

to be able to compose the overall

applications from these

to provide a real-time view and then

lastly how to

also compose and reuse recommendations

that trigger when certain critical

things

happen you don't want to recreate all

the prescriptive

support in the business you actually

want to be able to compose certain

certain capabilities around that or

package some capabilities around that

and then compose it when you

need it so with that let me show you an

example of how this works

so i will move on to

and i'll just maximize this so i'll

start with

the data stream area as we mentioned

this is

the first part of the

of the process in step one it's where we

integrate

data into the system and i will just use

a

very quick simple example this is not a

full demonstration of our solution or

software if you do want there is a link

on our website you can see a full

demonstration of all the capabilities of

the software i'm just going to touch on

some of the key elements and show you

how some of those capabilities are

packaged i'm just going to use an

example

of a pump condition monitoring solution

that runs on something like azure

digital twin

and we have these different capabilities

that we've packaged so we call them

agents but they are they have different

functions that they

that they that they perform or so they

have certain capabilities they could

either be listeners so they listen for

real-time data

which is something like the telemetry

they could provide context so a

different

capability they could transform data

it could provide a machine learning

capability

and i'll drill down into into this a

little bit more

it could be things like functions like

fast fouriers or or things like that

which again is a package capability

and then run recommendations and

different actions so these are all

package capabilities and we'll drill

down on them a little bit more but

just to quickly explain the process that

we have here we're taking pump telemetry

data do some calculations for that push

it into

azure digital twin and also getting make

and model in context

combining that with the telemetry data

and running some engineering

recommendation rules that sit behind it

very simple example

but there are a number of package

capabilities in here that i can reuse so

one of them

for example is the pump telemetry so

this brings in real-time data from a

data source now i don't have to

understand how to code

mqtt or anything like that i can just

literally hook it up

to what the endpoint is where it sends

the data and it will then expose

the fields that it's got and i can reuse

or i can use these two so and again in

this one

this is the data that comes from

the pump telemetry i can either use all

of them or i can remove

just the ones that i that i want or need

now the way that i get that on

is i can literally drag the mqtt

package business capability onto the

canvas again i don't have to know how to

code this

i can just drag it on and use it

likewise with the um

and i'll just go to this one azure

digital twin

the capability here is around

um being able to interrogate

the the the or automatically publish to

azure digital twin but as you'll see we

don't only do azure digital twin here

we also push the real-time telemetry

into

time series insight so i can get some

time series

data if i want to again i don't have to

be able to code any of this i don't have

to understand how to do this in actual

fact being able to create new resources

on azure if you're not a

qualified azure engineer cloud engineer

this is not a

easy task we've made it much simpler by

being able to

create new resource instances for anyone

that's tried this you'll understand

exactly the value of having this package

business capability where i don't

i don't have to be a subject matter

expert also

a cloud deployment engineer i could be a

subject matter expert like a reliability

engineer process engineer a

geologist or someone like that who just

wants to set up a twin

in this service again this is a package

business capability i can drag it on i

can build

digital twins for for different

solutions it could be a pump assembly it

could be turbines it could be

buildings it could be anything so i

could upload new models here i don't

have to understand how to create

or um or write code for azure digital

twin i can

literally just reuse this

package business capability in order to

do that

and then things like azure digital too

sorry

time series insights if i want to push

the data into that

i can i can do that as well and one of

the benefits of

doing this approach is we can discover

for example the data that comes from

this package business capability

remember that

challenge with the different wall

sockets where i have different systems

that speak different

inputs and outputs what i can do with

this is

you know on this yellow arrow that i've

map that i've that i have here

it actually shows me the payload that

comes in the arrow so these are the

options that i have that comes in via

the arrow

and this is the service that i

interrogated on the other side so i

looked at what the wall plug needs

and this is that multi-plug capability

that now

make it easy to take this format into

this format

and the two can talk to each other very

powerful capability especially when it

comes to package business capability so

each of these can stand on its own

and again it might be something like i

want to bring in a

python environment so i can drag on a

python

script and wire it into the process and

i'm not going to do that right now

but i can wire this in and

and do something now this means i'm

handling a specific

error capability that comes out of

this and i can reuse this capability

very

easily so this is on the on the data

stream and integration side again this

is not a full presentation

but it gives you an overview what i

briefly want to touch on

and i'm just mindful of time is our

capabilities around

the composition environment so for that

digital twin that we just saw so if i

for example go to uh

this view over here so this is a front

end

i can compose and set up

my my environment here and i'll show you

all this this application again in a

very similar way

in this instance i'm bringing in data

from unity

i've got this unity view of a pump the

real-time data coming out of azure

digital twin

i've got some information coming out of

my erp now all of these are drag and

drop components

um from a composability point of view so

in this instance i might be doing

predictive maintenance on

or it might be way or it might be it

doesn't really matter what the use case

is i can very quickly adapt and change

based on a business problem that i may

have

and reconfigure this in order to be able

to do that now the way that i do that

again this is this capability around

packaging

and what you'll see so as the

subject matter expert i can't change

this one

because it's running and i'll get in

trouble if i screw it up but

i can drag on certain capabilities you

know it might be something

like um power bi

i think there's a there's a power bi or

it might be

esri maps or anything like that so again

package capabilities

that i that i just drag on and there's a

whole

it could be bentley autodesk um a broad

range of these

of these package capability in addition

to

simpler ones like what might be unity or

unreal engine

or it might just be a grid or a circular

gauge or something like that

it could be widgets so you can compose

and put together so i could take this

whole

section over here so this section or let

me just

let's say i like this whole section and

i want to save that i won't be able to

do it yet because

this is a live running one but i could

typically

save this share it with myself or others

and now i've published this capability

of package this

look and feel and i can share it with

myself i can use it for myself or

share it with others again very powerful

capability from a

from a composable digital twin

aspect in order to create these

composable uxes

that are that are that are built and

with the data integration and everything

that's it's

behind it likewise with um

and i'll just use this example again uh

i'll go back to that pump

and likewise with something like the

recommendations i may have a form

with certain information that i fill in

work order numbers create

instructions or i could reuse this for

everything that is similar

but this is the real-time data that

triggered and put the

red dot onto that screen how i resolve

it

i could have trios instructions i could

have discussions around this

i could have a timeline view on who did

what when

and as well as some analytics on this

and i'm not sure what we have for this

as you can see we had a whole bunch of

different

recommendation rules that triggered and

fired

for all of this there's a whole section

in the presentation

or the demonstration video on

recommendations a really powerful

capability inside xm pro it is a

package business capability which is

generically used as

recommendations but it's really really

powerful in terms of closing the loop

digital twins are there to address a

certain

challenge you're hiring a twin to do a

certain job

and you want to make sure that you're

able to close the loop

provide tell someone when something's

happened

and do the notification and everything

that sits behind that but also then

provide recommended actions instructions

forms that needs to be filled in and

all of this needs to be is is built in

such a way that it's easily

composable as well as reusable

so with that um hopefully that gives you

an overview of

what a a a composable digital twin is

and i will go to some questions

and see if there are any questions

around this

so let me just have a quick look here

so how granular should the capability be

in order to be effectively

packaged into a business capability

i think that's a great question so it

needs to be

according to that definition that i gave

uh i gave earlier it needs to be

um it needs to be able to stand on its

own so i need to be able to package and

if i just use an example here i need to

be able to

package a capability where for example a

fast fourier

i want to have that whole capability so

in terms of granularity

um it needs to be able to stand on its

own and it might also be something like

this azure digital twin where it can do

two things for me so it really depends

on on the on the use case that you

that you have what i wouldn't do is make

it so granular that it needs two or

three

together to actually make it work so

what is the

what is the lowest level or the

the smallest module that i can get to

that would still be self-sustainable so

when i drag a fast fourier on

that i just need to pass it the

parameters and it will give me an answer

and the rest of the flow can continue so

that's typically how we would

look at um composable uh or the

the pbc the package business capability

something like leak detection

or um remaining useful life

or something like that it needs to have

the net the smallest number of

components that will actually address

the capability and provide the full

capability

um for that for that for that specific

function that we are looking at it

doesn't have to address so pump con mon

this whole condition monitoring

that is kind of i wouldn't package this

as a as a or i have a whole package

business capability or

might be that in your use case that

would work that you have

this as the package business capability

but quite often we

we see that there are some nuances some

changes

and if you make it too big it needs a

lot of customization

where with something where where um it

is

contained like this it just makes it

really easy

to be able to drag it on and address my

specific challenge

uh there's one more question

i appreciate the application of

gartner's high level thinking into the

real world

um that being said much of the

presentation seems to reflect

um sort of the more forms based approach

asset intensive industries will also

require that digital twin support field

user experiences

what i forgot to mention is all of this

what you see on the front end

if i just go back

to what you see over here all of this is

available

on mobile devices so it is it is there

so you can take it into the field

um and it automatically so as you can

see when we design this you actually

design

and again from a pack from a business

capability we need to make sure that

these things run in different

environments so it is designed so that

the field service organization can use

it but the rest of the question

is that they will require xr

applications so that's ar

vr on all of that absolutely so the same

way that we are doing

things like unity and the others

expanding the business capability on a

continuous basis we have a team that

just look at this

is how do we how do we create

more um whether i just want to see the

ar and vr on my

on my mobile device or is it something

that i want to put a headset like a

hololens or which right now

it's not that industrial but you know

there's a lot of development happening

in that and

again in the next 10 years if we look

back

10 years from now we will we will see

very different technologies

and yes a package business capability

around arvr

is a critical aspect of that so for us

and there are standards emerging around

that so we will

for us the focus is to make sure that we

continue the composability across the

whole

a continuum of of user experiences that

are out there

great question thank you very much also

appreciate everyone's time on this

if anyone's got more questions if you

have a question around this please feel

free to

reach out to me i'm happy to address any

questions

on this again have a look at the

demonstrations on our website

and look forward to seeing you on a

continuation of this topic

in future webinars thank you very much

appreciate your time
