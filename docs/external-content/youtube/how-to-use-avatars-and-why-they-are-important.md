the last thing I'll leave you with in

here is you'll notice you can change

your avatar as more and more of you of

using this as you start sharing apps

between each other what I would suggest

you do is if you click your avatar on

the top right and you click edit

it'll open up the subscription manager

and you can edit your details update an

avatar upload an avatar for yourselves

doesn't need to be your your picture

um you know but the the intent is you'll

see as you start publishing and sharing

apps it'll start showing up in here

versus the default again that's the

default

just something to keep and keep in mind

as you are working through this because

you're going to start creating you know

a bunch of data streams you're going to

start creating a bunch of apps and

things and you're going to start sharing

them with with your yourselves with

other people

you may do a presentation

um so you you just want to make sure

that you've uh you've done all that you

can to make it presentable
