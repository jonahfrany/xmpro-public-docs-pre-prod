digital twins are quickly becoming the

buzzword in Supply Chain management but

why all the hype

simply put a digital twin is a virtual

representation of a physical asset

process or system it is created using

data and information from the physical

world and it can be used to simulate and

analyze the performance of the physical

asset process or system

imagine being able to detect and address

potential issues with your equipment

before they occur or optimize the

routing of your goods for maximum

efficiency and cost savings

this is where digital twins come in

this YouTube video we'll summarize ways

that digital twins can improve Supply

Chain management if you would like to

dive deeper you can read the full

article on our website

the link is in the video description

transportation is a critical component

of Supply Chain management and it can be

a significant source of costs and

inefficiencies

digital twin technology offers a

solution to these challenges by allowing

companies to optimize their

transportation routes and reduce costs

by creating a virtual model of a

transportation Network digital twin

technology allows companies to simulate

and analyze different Transportation

routes

this can be done by analyzing data such

as traffic patterns weather conditions

and vehicle capacity with the potential

to reduce costs and improve efficiency

digital twin technology is an essential

tool for companies looking to improve

their transportation routing

in our next section we will see how

digital twins can be used to optimize

supply chain networking design in order

to improve efficiency further digital

twin technology can be used to create a

virtual model of a supply chain Network

allowing companies to simulate and

analyze different network designs

by analyzing data such as demand

patterns production capacity and

inventory levels digital twin technology

can help companies identify the most

efficient and cost-effective network

design lastly digital twin technology

can be used to create a virtual model of

the production process allowing

companies to simulate and analyze

different production scenarios by

analyzing data such as demand patterns

production capacity and inventory levels

digital twin technology can help

companies anticipate and plan for

fluctuations in their operational

environment building digital twins is

now easier than ever before with XM

Pro's no code digital twin composition

platform you can build digital twins

that offer real-time event intelligence

as well as prescriptive recommendations

without ever touching a line of code

<summary>Transcript</summary>Welcome to the XMPro tutorial on 'How to Use Avatars and Why They Are Important'. In this comprehensive guide, we elucidate the process of customizing your avatar within the xmpro platform....
the last thing I'll leave you with in

here is you'll notice you can change

your avatar as more and more of you of

using this as you start sharing apps

between each other what I would suggest

you do is if you click your avatar on

the top right and you click edit

it'll open up the subscription manager

and you can edit your details update an

avatar upload an avatar for yourselves

doesn't need to be your your picture

um you know but the the intent is you'll

see as you start publishing and sharing

apps it'll start showing up in here

versus the default again that's the

default

just something to keep and keep in mind

as you are working through this because

you're going to start creating you know

a bunch of data streams you're going to

start creating a bunch of apps and

things and you're going to start sharing

them with with your yourselves with

other people

you may do a presentation

um so you you just want to make sure

that you've uh you've done all that you

can to make it presentable

embed interactive 3d models in your

digital twin applications with XM pro

enhance your remote condition monitoring

and simulation applications with highly

realistic 3d visualizations both on the

Unity game engine X and Pro allows you

to embed 3d models in your real time

apps you can simply drag and drop the

unity model block onto the app designer

canvas configure where the data comes

from and then see your 3d visualization

come to life when building simulation

digital twins in X and Pro you can also

input data to simulate specific

conditions and then get instant feedback

from the changes to your 3d model we've

made it easier than ever to update 3d

models in real time without custom

coding X and pros data stream designer

comes with a library of pre-built

connectors which also includes a unity

action agent this agent enables you to

continuously send a real-time data to a

3d unity model it can update the model

when changes occur in the data like

making a pump appear red when it's

temperature goes above a certain

threshold so whether you're building a

digital twin for a specific asset type

or an entire plant you can now virtually

navigate and interact with its 3d model

in real time
