Hosted by XMPro...
welcome everybody um to today's webinar

um thank you for joining I'm Peter F

Scar and we'll talk about gen Ai and

digital twins in

2024 so with J AI uh

Steve hoft um Co actually reminded me of

this when you look at something like

geni and the impact of that um the the

what comes to mind is that it's almost

like magic so if you look at what's

what's happened over the last um year or

so in the space significant changes and

for me it's not so much um around the

the um the the the magic side of it it

is more the impact that it's got so and

it reminded me of the book uh who who

Moved My cheese where um it's all about

change and how we we adapt to new things

that are that are coming in so in that

story um when the cheese was moved the

the target the goal the the the

environment some like the the mice

adapted very well and some people didn't

um and yeah so this is kind of bringing

that um that thinking around what the

impact of digit of of generative AI is

and if you combine that with digital

Twins and how it's changing the

landscape the the changes that we see

especially in 2024 revolve around three

main areas the first one is we're seeing

a a a ground swell of challenges around

skills so lack of skills aging Workforce

in maturity and I'll drill down a little

bit on that but there's some significant

ific challenges ahead in terms of

getting people to work in manufacturing

likewise with the acceleration of of AI

and we've seen a lot of things like

co-pilots and and that happening last

year this year we'll see a lot of

experimentation moving to actual

implementations and adding value and

it's not just the novelty Factor anymore

but um the the the applications that

come out of it and lastly we also see

that the industry for. digitization

digitalization is picking up a lot of

momentum but is it really adding a lot

of value um and what we need to do in

terms of to boost productivity which is

a key challenge in the industry um we've

seen many of the developed countries are

either um stagnant or declining

productivity so how can we get more with

less people which is really what that

what that statement is about so those

three things is creating this perfect

storm for for how I believe um

generative AI will disrupt how we work

going forward if I look at the uh change

in Workforce in the next 10 years this

is from Gardner and I'll just summarize

it into those three into those three

things the workforce um is actually

growing slower than what the GDP is the

manufacturing Workforce is shrinking in

terms of real numbers so getting people

to come in and work in in manufacturing

and Associated Industries in the in the

industrial side is actually shrinking

and and one of the other statistics is

that one in four people in the next um

in the next 10 years in the next decade

will actually be over 65 that is still

in the workplace uh because of this lack

of skills now again looking at some of

the things that g is saying around what

are the type of jobs or tasks that we

can automate and the ones that are

ideally suited um to completely

digitalized you can see the bottom Green

in each of those production schedu and

quality so these are the type of tasks

that lend themselves to being um

automated to some degree and I'll touch

a little bit on how we at X and pro are

looking at at at that part of the

problem so I think generative AI um you

know people are saying well will this

replace jobs will that put people out of

work our real problem is we don't have

enough people to do the work that we

have there's a decline as I showed

previously but what was interesting Sam

Alman um CEO of open AI which also um

owns uh jgpt which is kind of

skyrocketed this whole thing uh made the

statement that AI tools are very good at

doing tasks but terrible at doing jobs

for now so the the focus of the AI tools

is not to replace jobs not to replace

people but to look at what of those

tasks that we can actually

automate um and and use the uh um

generative AI to be able to support us

in doing those tasks so we can get

people to do some of the other more

value added tasks so just on the if you

look at CH GPT and how quickly this is

on us and this is fascinating if you

look at how long it took Netflix to get

to to a million users and Facebook and

Instagram and and Chad GPT this is

phenomenal 180 million users and they

reckon there's about 100 million people

signing in every week um to use the

service so phenomenal with that if you

look at someone like Michael Dell who's

been around um the industry for a really

long time

um and he's seen many many waves what

he's saying is so far um there's nothing

that competes with what he's seeing on

this um on on what's happening with j

really interesting stat that I saw from

my Carol who's with um Georgia Pacific

um is you know how the productivity

which is really the output per hour how

that has changed over the last couple of

years you can see every time we had new

technology internet of things all of

that we get more for the labor that we

put in the challenge that we have is

this is gone completely flat um and his

point is that the more we put just

dashboards and and Analysis and

putting bi over um the information we've

not made any significant progress since

we've done that so what do we need to do

to get a step changed and it remind me

reminded me something or of the of the

great crisis in London New York and

places like that where they said in in

1894 that in 50 years London will be

buried under 9th fet of manure um and

there were conferences and a lot of

debate and what are we going to do

because we looked at the problem from

the horse perspective by 1912 Henry Ford

um got um the way that we make cars into

a repeatable process and since then that

problem has gone away so not within the

50 years but it completely changed and I

think gen AI is that complete change

that we seeing so this combination of

the three

trends that creates this this perfect

storm and if you combine this with

digital twins to shift towards digital

twins so Dr Michael Greaves um explained

you know what he sees as a intelligent

digital twin which compared to

traditional ways which is passive

offline goal given and predictive he

sees a digital twin which is active

always on agents real time goal seeking

versus and goal given and doing things

like front running simulations being

able to do that so it's not so to get

back to kind of the cheese and

analogy um it is not a better Mouse

straap it is a completely different way

that we have to think um so it's not

about the HSE manure problem it is about

how do we how do we change that whole

dynamic and address um the creating the

the vehicle change that we need so it's

not uh smarter repositories with more

data if you ask anyone they just want

more data it's not about um measuring

things like more kbis or building better

AI models or analytical models it's

about a whole shift and that's what we

are focusing on so our Focus um and how

I think geni will impact digital twins

is really in three area so how do we

generate twins so I call that generative

twins so how do I create a twin right

from getting the requirements designing

it building it testing it and putting it

in place the second part is how can I

make it smarter how can I put

intelligence into it because there's a

massive amount of information available

in large language models and you know

the the way that the that that g CH GPT

type applications are developing and the

information that sits in there billions

and billions of data points that it's

been trained on much better than any any

users how can we use that to provide

better co-pilots help with Advanced

analytics and decision making and things

like that so how do we not just build

but also create the intelligence and

then lastly how can we get them to do

some of these tasks and work for us so

we see this and um the term multi-agent

generative systems are being raised at

the moment by organizations like Gart

and other research it is very new um but

this is actually when you have multiple

autonomous agents that work together in

this goal-seeking

approach um but they have to work with

inside Rules of Engagement so I'll

quickly go into each of these and just

give you a view on what they are and

what we are doing as X and Pro in this

space so the first one is how do I

create um a digital twin and the the

reason that we see or the the benefit of

this is really quite often people are

stuck at how do I get started so we this

it helps you with with getting started

it helps you to collaborate around key

objectives that this that your solution

need to do and don't wander off around

one person's bias or a technology that's

really interesting it Focus around key

objectives it helps you build these

things a lot faster we anticipate around

about a 50% so we're still in testing

all of this but we anticipate around a

50% faster development overall um right

from requirements Gathering to get it

into into running and it helps you

sometimes to think out the box because

we are so trained and biased around you

know the world that we

know um that similar to what they had in

London New York and places like that

previously do is work in progress for us

so uh it you'll see this being released

throughout the course of the year um all

the things that I'll be sharing with you

so looking at this generator process we

broke it down into six steps so to get a

co-pilot to help us um defining the

requirements doing the data management

things like generative integration how

can I discover autodiscover apis and

actually build the mapping for me um

come up with what are the

recommendations that I that will help me

to identify the problem and and and and

um help me um provide prescriptive

analytics some ideas around what should

be on the ux how do I align that with

the user stories um and then actually

create the configuration actually create

the ex in our instance XM Pro Data

stream configuration files um and some

of the other IDE defacts that we need

the rec the recommendation files so that

those can be imported into the process

um and help you speed up

so uh and also gr documentation and then

lastly make sure that we can put

security and governance auditing use

this as an auditor to put that over this

as well so here's an

example um this is inside X and pro and

again I think this process is pretty

generic how we've implemented or how we

are implementing this is there are

multiple different use cases that you

see here you can see the five steps at

the Top If I choose one of them I can

then go into it there are the six

objectives and each of these will then

take me through a series of question

questions and um and prompts I can

prompt and it can prompt me back so if I

look at for example identifying key

objectives and

challenges so it'll start off by how do

you describe the business of problems

and so and there's a set of of questions

built on our methodology that we have

found very effective in working with

customers so how can we bring that and

make that available to anyone who's

trying to do this in this instance for

my cheese manufacturing organization you

can see a number of number of questions

and then at the end of it for step one

it'll start summarizing the results for

me so but that is learning so that I can

put this all together at the end and

actually create that configuration file

so and here are just some of the outputs

um of that so once that is done I can go

into the next um Step of this process so

being able to generate twins we

anticipate about a 50% reduction in time

and again this is new um you can help

you identify unanticipated needs it's

one of the benefits that we saw out of

it sometimes you don't think of it and

and uh the intelligence that's in this

agent allows you to to or will

interrogate will ask you questions which

you might not have thought of and the

real thing is that it can help you build

a digital twins around the real problem

statement here's an example of what came

out of a session like that where this is

the problem statement around the you

know what what where who why you know

what is the problem why you're doing it

how you going to do do this who is it

for and what are the key benefits it is

really good at taking all of those

questions from multiple inputs in

different stakeholders and helping you

to put this together so that is how we

build the twin the next part is how do

we put some intelligence into the twin

um how do we how do we um create smarter

twins so we don't just build them but

now we make them smarter and um I know

it's a Cheesy story but um I'll get back

to kind of the life of um

a day in the life of a cheese plant

operator who's assisted by co-pilot and

this co-pilot is really good as a

process advisor as you will see so

here's our stock standard dashboard for

a or digital twin um representation of a

um a cheddar manufacturing

um uh uh operation and you can see

across the top of the process I can see

different batches where they are what

the statuses oee all the normal things

that I that I like to see inside um my

normal application at the top right I

have an advisor if I click on that it

now opens up um a area where it will

actually look at what is currently there

what is what are the current um um uh

instances and what you'll see on the

recommendation side on the right hand

side out of the box X Andro allows you

to create recommendations with

recommendation rules and some of our

customers have actually got millions of

recommendations over three or four five

year period that they've gathered we can

interrogate this also with the digital

twin in this instance looking at the

process data um it can recommend what

queries you may want to run but I want

to and in this instance I'm asking it

what pasturization temperature and

duration yielded the best result in the

past so I'm looking for this golden

batch um in all my previous ones and see

if I so that I can that that I can build

a solution around or um a golden batch

approach so it will then interrogate the

data that is sitting inside our

application and this is um and it

provide me different ways of

demonstrating and showing that um

information whether I wanted graft or

and again this is all built into how I

can ask it certain questions around this

I may see that there's an issue with the

pasturization so you can see at the top

at the top there's a red box that um

shows me there's a there's an issue um

so that pops up and that's all part of

our standard recommendations you don't

have to do anything to get that

functionality there no AI involved in

that you can if you want uh put some AI

into the recommendations but those are

stock standard recommendations what I

tells me there's an issue with this

machine I can now go in and I can use

traditional AI where I do remaining

useful life and run regression models

and classification models and all those

things which is again standard in X

Andro you can get get that right now

there are some previous webinars that

discuss that in this instance um what

I'd like to do and having a trained on

our own company data our own operations

manuals our own recommendations uh I can

now start interrogating this so show me

that the temperature Trend around this

for the last 12 months and um with some

interpretations of what does it mean so

two instances were out of had anomalies

or whatever the case might be and then

um lastly show me this in a in a plot or

something these are all natural language

questions you can ask on your data at

any point in time so that's adding

intelligence to the digital twin now

just imagine so this is a water

treatment plant you can see there's a

camera with video on the side that

actually just imagine what it's like if

you could get the if you could get that

advisor to interpret what is actually

happening in that video and what does it

mean um so building that expertise at

becoming really really valuable assets

and workers in the organization it's not

just on the front end part of it but

expro has notebooks and we've had this

capability for a while where I plug in

ch GPT and I can do my analysis inside a

notebook which is where data scientists

engineers and people like that like to

take the expra data and and um and and

build models or evaluate or or or or

look for things and um in this instance

um I can ask it a question so

in Notebook using um exm Pro there's a

uh I can ask it how to how do I create a

correlation Matrix and again this is how

it creates the the python code for me I

can I run that then in the notebook and

here there's my visualization I didn't

have to know I don't know how to write

the the the code to actually create a

correlation Matrix um CH GPT did that

for me so that's the other area of a

co-pilot it's not just about your data

but also how to help you um um create

more intelligence or better questions so

again looking at this we see we

anticipate around about a 25%

productivity Improvement for people

using this we it's actually should

actually be more but um it also um help

you better decisions lower

cost better employees satisfaction and

it helps to create the self-service

analysis instead of going to an IT

organization and get them to write you a

SQL with a report that sits behind it so

that self that self-service analysis

really coming to the front the last part

is around how gen AI will impact digital

twins in 2024 is now it should do the

work not only do we create it we make it

smart but how can we get multi-agents to

do this now this is really um at the

Forefront of of where research and

everything is um it's a fascinating area

I personally believe this is the area

where there's most value because we're

taking the robot out of people and

making the world more human and that is

according to Leslie W Cox at London

School of Economics I love it um in

terms of what that approach means for XM

Pro we've seen that decision

intelligence is not just about

dashboards which is the support or the

decision augmentation which is kind of

bringing in these co-pilots but how can

we actually get in certain operating

conditions the the application to or the

the digital twin to run in a safe

operating environment for certain tasks

actually perform those tasks

autonomously in a lights out way and we

see this going from a informant approach

to a performant um solution going

forward so just imagine that cheese

factory again and in this cheese factory

I've got multiple agents now in a

traditional rule-based system I would

have to write all the rules with what

we're doing is the production agent the

process agent quality agent safety agent

have large language models behind them

so they are really smart around how to

interact how to plan and they have a lot

of knowledge around cheese they have a

lot of knowledge around safety and they

collaborate amongst each other in order

to achieve certain tasks now if you

expand that it's not just about the

production process but I could have the

same in the goods receiving packaging

and functional safety and I do need to

put some rules around it so these these

Bots or agents need to interact with

each other in that they virtual bots in

or or agents that interact with each

other in a collaborative way and they

use large language models as their way

of interacting and deciding what to do

next

um and and we then put the rules around

to say Within These in within these

rules you are allowed to interact with

each other and I'll get back to some of

what these what these

mean the this is how we see the

factories of the future where there's

certain tasks of this that can be done

and you know they can optimize a large

number of variables they're always on

goal seeking and they can reason like

humans in a

way this capability of machines being

able to manage more variables has been

proven by MIT at the machine

intelligence for manufacturing

operations side uh suggest that you have

a look at that but machines are much

better at optimizing a large number of

variables to what a human is there's

research done at places like standard

and Google Deep Mind and others around

this agent based approach how can agents

use large language models as their way

and we don't have to build all these

rules around them they can

discover um this is an example of and

these are real bots so this is a

physical what we are doing is the

virtual how do we build a digital twin

versions of this but these are eight

Bots that um interact with each other

they clean a room and

their focus is you know without having

procedural descriptions at the back but

using large language models on what I

should do what the task is how to break

it down how to actually perform it

fascinating stuff again if you're

interested have a look at Auto RT at

Google deep mine this is not what we're

doing we're doing this

around digital twins how can I create a

virtual approach that is similar to that

how can I get the digital twin to

actually run it instead of having robots

running around and what we've done at XM

Pro come up with a architecture which is

ideally suited to our stream hosts and

how we build applications right now so

we have data streams and stream hosts

and and the infrastructure that we can

plug these agents who can interact with

each other they can use exm Pro

listeners they can perceive in the

middle we have um the the actual we

train them on your company specific

domain knowledge um they have large

language models for their broader

understanding and there's reinforcement

learning to make sure that you know when

they reflect and plan that they that

they learn from what they do like we do

as humans like we do as when a new

person starts in our business it's

exactly the same process and then the

actions could be recommendation so

advising or we can actually um actuate

and switch things on and off um so

that's the that's the future this is

where we're heading and as I said X and

pro ideally suited to do this because we

already have the infrastructure event

based architecture so we are event

driven and we have data streams and data

and and a platform where we can plug

these things in

um this is all uh work from a the um

around the core of digital twins so we

have the digital twins we're building

the the generative agents to be able to

use the digital twins to interact and

and and um do this algorithmic business

and then what we're also doing is make

sure that we have the Rules of

Engagement in a computable way so the

agents can actually understand it so

what are the rules of engagement and

some of them may follow things like

deontic rules or more um so without

these rules you can't play it's the most

important part actually of this whole

thing is how do we make sure that it's

that we that we set that up and um the

way that we do that same same um outline

but it's the obligations prohibitions

permissions delegations all of those

kind of policies and how and how that

applies and how do we make it machine

readable and interpretable and enforced

by the multi-agent so again in the

multi-agent environment we're not trying

to automate not the job but the task so

let's say I've got two agents they need

to fill the milk tanks um they need to

consider power um milk levels

electricity prices maintenance schedules

production so between the operations

agent and the reliability agent they

need to negotiate they may have

competing objectives and they need to

need to negotiate around when to fall we

may then also later on introduce a

quality agent so again how do we

introduce this without procedural rules

that sit at the back um so that we can

address that challenge and XM Pro can

cover this whole Spectrum this whole

Continuum from one end to the other end

um starting with um where a lot of

organizations starts you don't have to

start at the right hand side start on

the left hand side and incrementally

increase and build the capability

towards that area where you can cover

the whole spectrum of what you need to

to support people to augment the

decisions and to take um so again in

terms of the impact of this is massive I

personally believe this is the biggest

thing we can do in this industry is to

help with that initial skills Gap and

the productivity challenge is to take

some of the T tasks that are repetitive

and don't add value um

to um and and and help address them by

helping to build helping to make it

smarter and helping to automate um the

whole process thank you very much um I

hope this has made sense um for us the

cheese hasn't moved we know where it is

um we are we we are going after it

unfortunately um we've run out of time

so there won't be time for questions um

but please contact me if you're

interested in exploring how we can help

you with this kind of problem and how

this could fit into your

organization um thank you very much

appreciate your time and look forward to

seeing you on a future

<summary>Transcript</summary>Welcome to our comprehensive webinar hosted by Gavin Green, our VP of Strategic Solutions, titled "How to Create Intelligent Digital Twins Using XMPro AI." We invite you to join us on this...
hello everybody and welcome to our XM

Pro AI

um for intelligent digital twins webinar

my name is Kevin green I look after

strategic solutions for XM Pro I want to

thank you for your time attending today

if you've got any questions please send

them through I'm not trying to answer

them at the at the end

in some prior webinars we went through

the four pillars of the the excellent

product I'm not going to go into detail

here

but just in a continuation of that which

pieces are we going to be focusing on

this is in line with our i3c framework

and it's in essence where we focus our

effort when we're putting the product to

Market and the different feature sets

that we are are working on

today's Focus however is going to be on

the AI side of things and what is in the

product that can help you for the

intelligent digital twins with the the

focus on the AI site

before we jump into you'll hear me

talking around intelligent digital Twins

and digital Twins and there is a

difference between the two of those

there was a paper that was written on

the evolution of digital twins

um the two fathers of digital twins

Being John Vickers and the second being

Dr Michael Greaves

um this is Dr Michael greve's vision of

the different stages of evolution of

digital twins these are some slides from

the paper the paper is available down

the bottom and if you're interested we

can send you the link where you can

access the paper as well and it outlines

the different stages and it's also used

as inspiration and a guide within our

software and what it is that we do the

the main Evolution steps you'll see them

on the right there going from zero being

traditional 2D

that evolved into transitional so you're

number one which was 3D cat that went

into number two around the conceptual

this is where

um things started becoming a lot more

model based and then that evolved into

the concept of a digital twin platform

the step number three this is where most

people are at the moment

and they are slowly moving towards the

the number four which is around

intelligent digital twins one of the

applications for intelligent digital

twins is front running simulation it's

by no means the the only one it's just

the one that's front of mind which helps

explain the intelligent aspect of that

as well

when we start comparing digital Twins

versus intelligent digital twins there

are certain characteristics of a digital

twin and then there are characteristics

of an intelligent digital twin I've just

built the slides here again I'm not

going to go into into detail here the QR

code in the middle will take you to a

video which will go into a lot more

around the digital twin capabilities and

characteristics and the intelligent on

the other side

the one piece right at the bottom is the

anticipatory or the front running

simulation side of things

keeping with the the XM Pro product

within our intelligent digital twin

suite for those of you who are familiar

you're familiar with the data stream

designer the DS the app designer which

is the ad here and the subscription

manager of the SM here

the new one which you may not have seen

is around the AI side

rounding out the intelligent digital

twin Suite here

we'll go into that quite a bit of what

I'm going to walk you through you can do

without and I'll touch on some of those

areas where you can and then also touch

on the areas where you do need the the

newest addition here which would be on

the on the AI side

we have to stop in at the tip of the

iceberg where does it slot in so when

most people look at our digital Twins

and this is true for normal digital turn

platforms all the way through to

intelligent digital turns as well as

most people look at the top and they see

the uis there's actually a lot of things

that sit underneath

which is where the recommendations come

in and this is also where we slot in the

AI aspect as well the AI integration the

notebooks as well as how you

operationalize this for the agents you

still have everything else as you are

used to you've still got your data

stream and you've got your subscription

manager as well

we're going to leave the slides here and

we're going to jump into the actual

software itself and we're going to go

through a few examples of what it is

that I'm actually talking about here

so what we put together is we created an

app which will just allow me to walk

through the different bits and pieces

that we've got

let me just get rid of my slides

and we'll come back to to this

so again this is all driven from an

overarching framework which is what we

call our i3c

um and it's broken up into a few

different areas specifically with an AI

Focus for today we're talking around

Innovative embedded and augmented but

how do they all fit together where do

they all work together

we like pictures so we like explaining

how all of these fit together

as it is right now without having to

upgrade any accent Pro you can do

everything on the right here we call

that embedded AI

from the data stream designer how do you

bring the models in maybe you've already

got some models how do you

operationalize them and use them

everything else on the left here is some

of the new capability that we've brought

in with regards to Innovative AI as well

as augmented AI it's not required you

don't have to you can choose to use this

or not use this as well

so as we go into these different areas

what do I mean when I start talking

around Innovative AI we start going into

Excel Pro notebooks and there's two main

items in here the one is around the

ability to discover

so you'll see on the left we have a new

tool and that'll open up what we call

accent Pro notebooks

within here for those who are familiar

and comfortable you'll notice a familiar

environment being a Jupiter notebook

that we've got here

so this allows you to discover work

through and come up with the different

models Etc

any of the libraries that you can use

within a jupyter notebook you can use in

here this particular example I've got

here you can see this is around

predicting and the the beverage industry

using linear regression

as I build through this particular

notebook here you can see I'm going to

import certain libraries and it's going

to walk me through the different pieces

here so if there's a library that

I need for my machine learning or I want

to do some data Discovery I can load it

into the notebook not a problem at all

the other thing that as we work through

this that we've added into this is a

generative AI capability as well

what we mean by that is as I work

through this you'll notice at this point

here we've integrated chatgpt into this

environment as well so what that means

is you can actually use the chat GPT

to help augment and enrich what you're

looking for in here this example that

I've got in here what we're actually

asking

um chat GPT to do is to write me some

code on how to visualize the data that

I'm looking at I'm not an expert in how

I put this together so we're going to

ask and it'll actually generate

the items for me and if I go and run

that now you'll notice that it's going

to run and then it will generate and it

once it comes back it'll actually show

me the plot for the data that I'm

looking for

scroll a bit further down you'll

actually see what that looks like

if we keep going you can start

developing different models as well

if I come back here step one is really

what we call notebooks which allows you

to interact in an environment which is

familiar to you

you don't have to use them in here if

you do use them in here you can start

using some of the other features and the

bits and pieces that we've made

available as well if you have your own

models and you just want to use them and

plug them in by all means you can do

that already in the steps here

the second piece is really when we start

wanting to deploy models so there's two

main things that you can actually do

with the model

the one if I go into a different example

here is I can actually run this

it will generate the model I can help

discover that and the end result is I

can actually save this model to a file

that I cannot use inside the data stream

you can do the same thing right now

let's say you have a jupyter notebook

that sits outside X and pro you've

already doing Discovery you're already

generating models how do you just use

those models and bring them in you can

do that and I'll show you in a data

stream as well

the second thing that we're doing in the

prior example though is we're actually

fitting this model and passing it to a

repository and the reason for this is we

want to introduce a concept of

governance

and make sure that there is a framework

that you can actually deploy into and

that your models can live so that you

don't end up with a an Excel of machine

learning model sitting everywhere no one

knows it's got the latest version of

where it's actually sitting

if you have your own repository by all

means you can actually hook into and use

that as well this example here we're

just talking to to Mr flow as the

repository this is just one example it

is not the only example so if you've

already got one by all means you can

just plug that in and actually use that

as I continue to step through all of

this what it's doing is it's working out

the model it's working out the pieces

and then it is actually publishing that

model to my ml flow repository for me

you'll see it has already existed it's

going to created me a version 5 of that

model and now I can go into my actual

repository and decide when I want to

deploy that or elevate it to production

or not

so if we jump into that and again this

is just one example that we've got it's

not the only repository you can see the

one that we've just pushed through now

so number four is the one which is

currently in production I cannot decide

that number five is ready to go and I

can transition it to staging in a

controlled environment versus working

out well which is my live running model

which one isn't and how do you in a

governance structure move between the

different Frameworks that we're actually

looking at here

number four is currently published and

I'll show you now where that is actually

published and running

so if we come back here we call that

Innovative AI so if I come back to the

diagram that we're looking at here this

is the area that we are working in at

the moment is how do we take training

data how do we ask for specific results

that we are looking for and how do we

run that through a notebook you can't

augment that with chat GPT in this

example and then deploy that to an ml

Ops platform of your choice

you don't have to deploy it you can just

take the actual raw artifact which is a

result of that model and then use it in

a data stream as well

the

preferred or the more governance driven

process is to actually push that through

a

repository because then you get

everything that comes with the

repository as well

I mentioned you can do things right now

you don't need to upgrade or get all the

newest toys in the Box to to be able to

do this this is around the embedded AI

side so if I go into and this will open

up my data stream designer for me

you can do this right now you can drag

on this example has got a python runtime

running here which is running a model

this model was created inside the

notebook it was outputted from The

Notebook and then manually put into the

data stream and used and this is

capability that you can do as I

mentioned right now we call that how do

you use it from a manual perspective

what you'll also notice is there are a

lot of other items in the library

so if python is just being one of them

but let's say you want to use a more

standard algorithm like anomaly

detection or binary classification or

clustering

those agents already exist you can just

drag them on and use them right now

there's nothing stopping you you do not

need a repository you do not need to use

the Excel Pro notebook to take um

advantage of that particular capability

however if you do use a repository

and you actually want to integrate and

make use of that inside the data stream

what we've got here is we're performing

the analysis so this is using the Mr

flow agent so on the left you will see

here is a list of library

one of those being the ml flow

the Mr flow is talking to the repository

and here you can see the actual model

that it's talking to and everything else

is governed as well so I don't need to

remember the URLs I don't need to

remember logons passwords Etc I just

want to use that particular model and

actually just run it and execute it

again this is your governance that sits

around it it makes sure that the models

which you're using to do anomaly

detection Predictive Analytics maybe

you're using it to do forecasting or to

do front running simulation or just to

do normal simulation of current state or

past State you want to make sure that

you're running on the correct model

latest model and that you have control

of that you can do that inside the data

streams that we're looking at in here

so again if we come back

Innovative AI this is a really around

the ability to discover

go in through the particular notebooks

and then how do you use some of those

libraries in there the other example in

here is you can actually just create

models that do simulation so you don't

need to create models that do very

sophisticated

um AI number crunching and algorithms at

output you can do something as simple as

just simulation which is what this

particular example here is doing we're

creating a network we are then deploying

the same model to the repository again

you don't have to

There's an actual example of this one

running just the python itself with the

simulation on top of that as well

this one here is doing a remaining

useful life as well as a more advanced

prediction on the data coming in the one

that I just showed you is doing more

simulation so it caters to to both

there's no

you can do one and not the other

if we go into the augmented side

let me expand that a bit here so

embedded again you can do this right now

there's nothing stopping you from using

the current set of libraries and we're

expanding and adding to those all the

time

ml.net are some of those that you're

seeing in there ml flow when you're

talking to repositories maybe you want

to use some GPU enabled

um

algorithms from the the Nvidia Library

you can do all of that right now within

the embedded side of things

the Innovative is around the notebooks

but augmented is not just in the

notebook section over here

the augmented

AI you can actually use inside your apps

when you create and configure them as

well

what do I mean by that oh let's go into

an example

so I've got a particular app here and on

the right you'll see some

recommendations have triggered

these recommendations you can see

remaining useful life has been declining

and I can go a bit further down and I

can see remaining useful life has been

predicted to be below a certain

threshold again these were running

through the data stream and they can

either be Standalone python or any of

the other algorithms or read the matter

or repository and execute them as well

if I drill into that particular asset

it'll actually filter out my

recommendations for the two that I'm

interested in across the top you can

actually view the state of the model and

you can view the state of the data

that's flowing through the model so

actual versus predictive how are we

doing are we getting better we're

getting worse

if you apply this to simulation you

could have a button here that you could

click and it can actually show you the

progression of a simulation as it's

running through the uh the model itself

these recommendations here

you'll see above that there's a thing

called copilot copilot you can actually

bring into the application and use it in

here so if I was to ask it a question

let me just grab my prompt

and paste that in there

I can engage and talk with it and ask it

anything around this particular asset

that I'm interested in

this is using currently chat GPT so the

the data that I'm looking for here is

not sensitive in that regard however we

do have some OEM

Partners who have gone and taken as an

example Azure open Ai and they are using

that on their own data their documents

their manuals and they've deployed that

internally as well

this is just easier to to demonstrate

and show the concept of how you can plug

this in and where we are busy plugin the

different bits and pieces in so even

though this is using a chapter GPT API

here you could switch this out and put

azure's open AI in here as well a lot of

problem to do that

you'll see the the recommendations

coming down

you can go and expand that further and

actually pass these recommendations into

the assets themselves so here you can

see a discharge exception and I can

actually see that in this particular

Unity view as well I've got more space

for my co-pilot

um but I can still see the relevant

information that is applicable for me

if I drill into these recommendations

and I'll drill into this one as an

example and then I'll open a few others

as well

this is your quick start for

recommendations that you've configured

what I mean by quick start

so let me go all the way back here and

open up a different example for you

so when I say quick start you have

certain capability that is available out

the box you get it when you install and

you can just use it there's some other

capability that you can actually

configure within the platform as well so

we have a lot of different widgets we

have a lot of different applications

that you can just import we have a lot

of different templates

one of those templates is around

recommendations so you'll see at the top

I've actually got two sets of

recommendations on this particular page

for the Top If I go into my one example

this is the recommendations that most

people are familiar with XM Pro would

actually be looking at

this is the the Quick Start

you can't really change anything here

from an end user's experience or even

from someone who's configuring it you do

have some some control over the form and

maybe the triage instructions here but

that's about it you can't change any of

the layout you can't add anything to

this particular form maybe you want to

enhance and bring some other data in

some other capability in here as well

so how do you actually do that

if we go down the bottom

you can actually take all of that data

and make it available in different views

that your end users are interested in

consuming

same data presented a bit differently

but what this allows us to do is we can

now bring in let me hit my other prompt

there we can now bring in the copilot

into here as well and this is around dry

gas seals I can see my event data for

the event that has happened I can see

analytics so how often is this actually

happening is there something that

happens at certain times is it happening

when other events are happening as well

so we're dealing with a pressure seal

that is low we may have some high

temperatures maybe all of this is

related and there is a correlation

between these as well

however if we go a bit further down you

can bring the copilot in here as well

so now you've got a co-pilot which you

can deploy and use on an actual

application itself at an asset level or

maybe all the way up at a landing page

for your different views or you can have

a view where you can have it all the way

down with your recommendation data as

well

so now as an end user I can decide and I

can work through and work out based on

what I'm looking at based on what I've

asked and the responses I am getting do

I need to create a work request can I

capture any notes what do I actually

need to do with this recommendation that

I'm looking at here

and again this recommendation was

triggered from within the data streams

you'll see there is a run recommendation

if I go into the other example you'll

see there is a run recommendation as

well so we apply the same patterns in

our data streams irrespective or if if

you're using a model that is coming from

a repository

in this case this one is coming from a

repository or if you're using some of

the standard inbuilt

algorithms are already there or if you

just want to go and run your own model

and actually use that in here as well

they all follow the same pattern the

output of that you can pass to

recommendations and Trigger

recommendations as well because that's a

key thing for us is making sure that we

can close the loop on any of these

events that we find it's one thing to

just have a model it's how do you

operationalize the model and make it

useful

with the outputs that are coming

this view here

you can then look at the data you can

view any of the model information and

now you have a lot of different options

and how you want to react to that

if I close that

and we come back to this particular view

here

so to go through the the items that

we've just gone through

we talk around Innovation AI

embedded AI as well as augmented AI

embedded AI you can do right now

we have the libraries we have the agents

if you need specific agents for specific

algorithms they're pretty quick and easy

to create they need to talk to a certain

repository you don't want to use the one

that I've just shown here maybe you've

already got your own

those agents can be created very quickly

and deployed and used

on the augmented AI site

you can right now bring in

if I open that up again you can bring in

things like co-pilot into your

applications right now there's nothing

stopping you there's there's no

capability that you're missing to do

that the only thing that I would suggest

is make sure that whatever it is that

you want to use here

um you understand the privacy concerns

with the data again we are using chat

GPT here we are busy I can't show you

the the things on the Azure open AI side

because that's typically trained and

running on corporate data or customer

specific data for their customer

so this you would just swap out same

capability exactly the same mechanism

it's just what's sitting behind that'll

actually change for you as well you can

do that right now

The Innovation piece here this is where

you need access to the excellent Pro

notebook here

to be able to run and configure what

you're looking at we do provide if I go

back into the router we do provide a

quick start as well

the quick start for if you're not

familiar with all the different

capabilities the markup that you need to

use and how you can configure this a

quick start will actually walk you

through as well it's available as soon

as you have access to the AI designer

you'll find it in the list here and it

has a index and it'll just run you

through all the bits and pieces you need

if you're interested in some of the

other examples that we've got you by all

means reach out and happy to happy to

discuss how we can share and learn from

this as well

okay let's see if we've got any of the

the questions we do have a few questions

that came in there so first one does XM

Pro have models

um great question we get that quite a

lot when people see all the different

pieces and capabilities we don't have

specific models that we make available

we're not a data science scientist

company

however we do have certain algorithms

that we do make available so for

instance anomaly detection regression

um

classifications Etc what we do do is

give you the vehicles and the tools to

operationalize your own models whether

those are coming out of a repository as

we did with this piece here or whether

those are coming out of a data stream

and you go and configure everything

whether it's in python or even if you're

more comfortable in our script and you

want to use that you can do that as well

so we're more vehicle that allows you to

operationalize versus do we have a model

that does X on this asset

second question

um I did touch on it a few times but

just to to go through it is I have my

own models and repository do you I need

to choose yours being XM Pro

uh or can that you can keep your own you

do not have to replace what you

currently have you do not have to swap

that out and use ours you can just

integrate from ours into yours that'll

mostly get done inside the data stream

from the agent's perspective over here

again if there isn't an agent that will

connect to your repository of choice

it's pretty quick and easy to actually

create these types of Agents we can

create them on your behalf quite a few

of our partners do that as well or we

can even show you how to create these

yourself as well

the last thing I will leave you with

is just before we wrap up again thank

you for your time

um to today and we do have a webinar

coming out next month as well where

we're going to be talking about the 4.3

release

um the QR code here will take you

directly to the registration page if

you're more comfortable you can type the

link in and go from there if you have

any questions

um you can email me directly or just

sales at actionpro.com and again thank

you for the uh the time today and have a

great rest of the day
