pick some fruit flies across the broad

range of roles and organizations but we

find that those who are really

responsible for the operational outcomes

operations manager service delivery

managers project managers people that

the operational role are the biggest

beneficiaries of this day they the ones

dealing with the unpredictability or the

uncertainty and they still have to make

sure that the operations in GP outcome

so they gave the eyes for business and

they need to make sure that we make as

many widgets create as many people and

there's many more wages as we need to as

we need to process and I work in this

unstructured war for them what keeps

them awake at night is this is really

how do I control the handler manager and

how do I manage the productivity from

operations for you and now that your

productivity smudges deficiency or our

fast videos but are we doing it right

the effectiveness so their productivity

measures of efficiency and effectiveness

and Israeli what it's improved ability

to make sure that we get control of

those unpredictable processes and once

we have control we can make sure that we

do the movie about that suits see how

service delivery manages and

managers and that's the key business

issues that we see see how those are the

ones that need to put in a beam

technology so it's not good operations

going to do all of it and you don't have

been a beam technology so the rather the

CIO and we see it is that they should

identify one of one of the best

solutions are they to solve that

specific business challenge and in the

season the business challenge is

handling unpredictability series is that

a really great job of putting it all the

line of business applications we it does

the back office where does all the

transactional stuff but the CRN's the

geography is the banking back office

systems all of those are the NCI is a

very really good gross of that I've done

a great job that the next body to enable

as not in workers and those people make

decisions with the right decision

support tools and also whether I crisis

management tools to get operations get

the maximum element in our experience

the bigger they are the more problems

they have the more uncertainty you have

the more unpredictability you have 10

people in your organization you probably

have a lot more control when you have

10,000 people in the organization a real

benefit reason these processes are not

hard with you in person organization all

right I think darling

the complexity lies with all the

variations of combinations the way that

you on board someone that why does she

do operations fundamentally doesn't

really differ and a high level between

you give you the fans actual details

that the complexity gets introduced as

soon as you have a broad number of

improvements so I travel experience

claims in their small business follows

exacting rappers what I've done in a

really large organizations is just so

many variations and exceptions in a

large organization okay you need to like

X and practicing for the certified

organizations the larger they are the

more the more challenges that have

around unpredictability and water
