hi and welcome to the ex-emperor future

of BPM just want to make sure that

everyone can hear me so if you can maybe

just confirm that you can hear me thanks

very much great work is changing faster

than ever and the way that we work is

also changing faster than ever we more

interrupt driven we have more

information or should I say data and

than ever and the world around us has

become a lot more unpredictable than

ever on Peter funds go back on the MD of

X in pro and I'd like to thank you for

joining me when we had when we have a

look at how we move from business

process management to what Gartner is

now calling intelligent business

operations and why we have to do this

and what the benefits is all of that

like you show them on the right screen

here so if we look at the drivers of

this change one of the aspects I'd like

to cover today and then also what just

some three elements of this internal

intelligent business operations or IBO

so i'll just be calling at IPO

intelligent business operations another

new free free letter acronym that we

have and lastly we'll also just have a

look of an example of what it could like

what IPO good look like and does look

like inside eggs and bro so why are we

now talking about intelligent business

operations what are the drivers for that

well

businesses and organizations that

support them or now more than ever a lot

more complex a lot more chaotic and a

lot more unpredictable at the recent

Gardner itexpo we were this CI our

summer the keynote cited that the

following disruptive technologies is are

changing the landscape for businesses

and specifically CIOs and CEO CFO's and

those drivers are essentially cloud

cloud adoption is a lot faster than what

most people anticipated and that brings

about a whole new change of how we work

social in the enterprise is there it is

found its way in and we actually have a

separate webinar that you may have seen

around social listening how we handle

social listening so social and social

media is now silence by into the

enterprise and it's not going to go away

so it's also changing the way that

people behave and that they expect the

tools that support them also change the

other interesting thing is that mobile

search is said to overtake desktop

search in the next two years we had a

conversation recently with the cio that

said their whole IT strategy has changed

overnight when see i walked in with his

ipad into a board meeting so those

drivers combined with the fact that we

have all these systems that now drive

data those three components plus the big

data that a lot of those generate are

the key drivers or the key disruptive

drivers according to gardiner why this

is all happening the challenge that we

have is how to make this work inside our

businesses and organizations so actually

have a great once again I'm going to

refer to 22 gardener for this and it

actually comes out of Janelle Hills

presentation around operational

resilience in where BPM is going and

she's saying that newer technologies

including social media context-aware

technologies cloud and all these things

that i've just mentioned the intelligent

funds and device

can revolutionize the way we work

together the challenge is enterprises

have not yet empowered frontline

employees to dynamically adjust the way

they work in response to these

contextual opportunities of threats and

I'll explain more of this as we go the

other thing that we find is that the

software that we use at the moment

cannot be applied to this knowledge

centric work style and decision making

risk assessment patent seeking and

matching group collaboration most of

these are are supported at the moment

with point solutions so you have a

specific application for for patent

seeking something for decision making

something for risk assessment but all of

these the way that we work all of these

are converging into a single environment

the biggest challenge is that as leading

economies are increasingly dependent on

service bass industries a lot of that

turns into the fact that the heavily

dependent on knowledge work on knowledge

workers and managers that understand

that and I all overwhelmed with data and

choices now that that is from from

Janelle hill at Gordon how do we turn

that into into or how does that relate

to what we know so what does that mean

for BPM and how did we go from workflow

which is factory style or automation of

work I'm just trying to get it done

faster to something like BPM with

business process management which is

knowledge style where we trying to have

more control of process if you look at

what the definition of process

management it's all around control and

and having a lot more management

capability rather than just automation

so that we have some idea of where it's

going business intelligent business

operation to me so when we start off

with workflow its factory style BPM its

knowledge style intelligent business

operation is all around a goal-driven

style we're actually trying to support

business outcomes of business objectives

that's not just around

sysctl having control and having ordered

trials and halving and halving decision

trials but it's also extending it to how

can we better support the outcomes of

business best way of looking at this is

just to looking at how the definition is

changed what what God has said a couple

of years ago we had a slide that says

BPM is ip-enabled management discipline

quite simple they've now changed the

definition looking at this operational

excellence where there's an expectation

for BPM to support not just the

automation or 18 Abelman of managing

processes but there's actually a bigger

expectation around BPM and that's moving

us towards intelligent business

operation so according to them BBM is a

management discipline that treats

processes that assets a key part you

need a repository of processes that you

can access and you can treat those as

assets inside the business they need to

contribute directly to enterprise

performance so you and a key element of

that which are like is the fact that

there's a clear line of sight for

metrics and outcomes so you need to

understand how this process that you

have as a process asset aw that's how

that contributes to what your your

operational excellence is which is the

next step here by driving operational

excellence and agility I did a webinar

not too long ago where I was talking

about these things that we do as

supporting operational kpi's in the end

of the at the end of the day the

operational kpi's or what or what

determines the success of a business so

looking at BPM going forward it needs to

be a lot more around visibility

accountability and it also needs to

change as processes need to change once

again I just want to highlight some of

the facts of some of the points if they

might be around the attribute things

like a clear line of sight

for metrics and outcomes and ability you

must be able to change it and the fact

that these the business models that you

construct are not just around the flower

but it redknee it needs to also show to

all process participants so that when

you drive a process from the intelligent

business point of view that you actually

know what the process is going to do and

you understand the options so if we look

at intelligent business operations

itself the the reason why it's moving

from BPM to IBO it's the fact that we

want to support this contextual

knowledge work what we mean by that is

people now have information around

activities that they do it's not just

factory style where I just accept what

comes from someone else and I just do my

little part of my activity or process

and pass it on that is a factory style

with it's almost like machines in the

sequence the way that we work now is we

get information by from various sources

and as we take that contextual knowledge

our processes need to support that

processes are not that sequential

anymore processes in actual fact they

can come from anywhere and i can go

anyway we need to have better support

for decision-making it's a key part of

intelligent business operations how do

we I don't make better decisions now

that we've got all this big data coming

at us we've got more dashboard tools

than ever we've got no matrix in ever I

do we apply that so that we can make

better decisions we don't work in

isolation so another objective of

internal of intelligent business

operations or IBO is the fact that we

need to take all these conversations

that we're having all the emails that we

send around which are currently not all

of our processes or workflows or B beams

and build that into bike that into our

processes so that we can incorporate

some of the social rules

that come out of that and essentially

all it is it's all around getting better

at getting work done which is what exome

pro is all about so if we look at BPM

going forward what does ibibo really

look like well in the first place it

needs to have support for unstructured

processes and also there's a previous

webinar where we discussed unstructured

processes to some degree but it really

means that there's no predefined flow so

there's a number of activities of

possibilities that we can do and we can

add to that so if we discover new

requirements that we have we can add

those what we mean by unstructured

process is you don't necessarily have to

draw the flow diagram and I'll get into

a little bit more detail around that it

also needs to have support for what we

call dynamic processes now on structure

doesn't mean uncontrolled and dynamic

processes are different to instruct

processes a dynamic process is where it

can change based on external events or

external influences or maybe site in

some instances internal rules that might

dictate and we'll look at some of the

examples of what a dynamic process is so

for intelligent business process it

needs to be able to be agile it needs to

be unstructured and flexible it needs to

be able to adapt itself by being a

dynamic and also it needs to incorporate

the social aspects of the way that we

interact in work we don't work in

isolation and there's a lot of

conversation that goes around our

activities and processes and all of that

combined gives us intelligent business

operations there are a few more elements

to it but these are the three main key

things if you look at why we looking at

at the intelligent business operations

or what does it mean for you it means

that we can cater for a broader range of

work we it's a lot more intelligent in

terms of heart can adapt and we also

incorporate conversations from outside

so if we look at those three elements in

a bit more detail so if i look at

unstructured dynamic and and social if

you look at unstructured to start off

with now this is a typical unstructured

process and then this is an XM pro

designer and this is just a very simple

example but for example if there's an

opportunity management where we're going

to capture opportunities we might decide

to have bed committees we can create

quotes we can send for technical

adjudication there's credit checks and

all sorts of things that can be done you

don't have to draw the flow diagram

because this can happen in any sequence

this we refer to as I process bant'ena

so there's a container and i can add new

process elements to this in order to

cater for my requirements so as you can

see there is no predefined flow setup

you can include some rules to make sure

that there are certain flowers that are

enforced in certain conditions and that

is an aspect which which is driven by

the dynamic side so even a a controlled

process is a specific price of a dynamic

process with certain rules are applied

so unstructured process means from

intelligent business operations point of

view it means we've moved on from work

flow where we have work flybys tools

that have a predefined routing because

because of mine my contextual knowledge

I know that I may want to send it to a

bit committee in certain instances it

will force me to send it a bit committee

and I'll touch on some of those rules

the benefits of this is it's actually

less costly and more adaptive to

builders so as soon as you discover new

requirements it's quite easy to adapt

you don't have to get it's not so when

you've got a brief bolt and a complex

workflow and set up in order to change

it is actually quite costly with this

approach that we have around

unstructured process is actually quite

easy we can drag another or drop another

activity into the process container and

very quickly expose that to the business

users at a very low cost the other thing

is you spend less time designing and

more time doing we find we find there's

a big resistance in trying to get to the

one hundred percent

process people don't get to that point

you can spend a lot of time what we call

analysis paralysis so you can spend a

lot of time trying to get the one

hundred percent model and by the time

that you that you actually get to run it

and automate it that it's actually out

of out of date so with this approach the

benefit is that you can spend less time

designing and more time doing so it's a

lot more of an agile approach we'll take

what we have and we can start we don't

have to wait to get the perfect the

perfect process because we will never

get there and it also takes away that

and that fear of analysis paralysis we

can experiment we can we get gives us a

lot more from a business perspective a

lot more agility and a lot less effort

required to actually get started because

we don't have to think about what the

process is that exactly going to look

like what we can do once we've got it

working is we can actually analyze the

data and look at how many times didn't

did it follow a certain path now that is

something that I'll touch on but light

in the presentation when I show you some

examples but this we can now use to come

up with what we think the next base

action would be for example so the

reason why one of the key are the

benefits of of knowledge style of this

unstructured processes in a knowledge

style work is traditionally when you do

knowledge they'll work what we mean by

knowledge style is I don't I don't want

to follow the workflow because I know

it's not going to work so that's how I

always typify what I what a knowledge

style worker will say when I look at a

process we now given the option to

rather than you which way they want the

advantage is that we still have a older

trial in place so we can still see that

process as part of our order trial we

can still see what decisions were made

even though we didn't force the route

that they needed to go down a critical

element which is missing from most

processes right now if you have

unstructured processes in your

business and that happened via email it

happens via word documents spreadsheets

and all sorts of things like that that

go around because structured workflow

doesn't cater for the requirement the

flexibility the problem is that you have

no order trials order that great

examples of things like customer service

guy style we've got we've got an audit

trail of of a customer service request

the things that can go to do a number of

people be handled on in a number of ways

and it's critically important that you

have an order trailer of that knowledge

style work that goes with it if you've

got a dog data entry in a complex

environment and I'll show you example of

of that in the next screen where this

you don't have you can't determine what

data you're going to get next you once

again as a customer service environment

and there's just a lot of data that

needs to go into into into the initial

part of a process and it can come from

any time any place anyway the other the

other example of where information can

come from and what you need to do with

it is for example social listening and

once again if you look at our social

listening webinar you'll see this in

action where you can actually listen for

tweets for example fraud Twitter that's

all around examples in your business and

now you can route the response to that

with your retweet whether it goes off to

customer service where the gods of the

marketing whether it goes of the public

relations or and if we have to add more

people we can actually we can actually

handle that on a case by case basis so

unstructured processes have a very

strong case approach to them as well so

you almost handle it on a case-by-case

basis the rules change case-by-case and

social listening is is one of those now

I mentioned the data entry example this

for example is a complex data entry

environment where the process to capture

the information in and from a funeral

arrangement or Rangers point of view now

there's a lot of information that they

need to get around funeral options

obviously they selling inventory items

to do the family they need to do

specific arrangements around cause

viewing there's a lot of things that

need to be done with that the challenge

that you have is you don't get the

information in a nice sequential

sequence it really comes to you over a

two or three-day period in a very

specific in a very erratic on an ad hoc

manner you need to have the ability to

to capture that at some point in time

you need to run a rule and side do I

have everything that I need do you and

to move this on in in terms of the

process or is there still some

information not staining so some of the

fields are required in order for this

process to actually move forward but it

gives as you can see there's a whole

number of options here and these are all

independent activities that that that we

can choose at any point in time to

actually route the work too so we call

with the way that we can add though if

we just add a new container if we need a

new step in here we can add it in here

with what we call our dynamic allocation

logic very simple and easy way to add

processes to ex-emperor dynamically

example of the twitter feed i'm not

going to go through the whole example

again but in this instance we were

listening for qantas when they had some

issues and they said certain things that

you can do it can be PR action can be

bookings now the nice things once again

we have a full order trial of so we pick

up the tweet and then we have a response

to that they can be multiple outcomes to

that so that is a typically a typical

unstructured process because it still

relies on a knowledge worker to read the

message and decide what to do this is

not there's nothing there's no automatic

routing or artificial intelligence built

into this intelligent business

operations are really there to support

knowledge workers to actually get better

at doing this and that was the example

of of Twitter so if we look at dynamic

processes as I said structured but

unstructured processes and dynamic

processes actually differ to some degree

dynamically dynamic processes imply that

that I that I dynamically change based

on certain events that occur and I'll

address some of those events in a minute

or so these these dynamic processes are

also context the way so they know what

goes on around them and now let's show

you some excellent some examples of what

context-aware means and then lastly

they've got built in predictive

analytics and what that means is it will

actually show you information that will

help you make better decisions and

sometimes based on that analytics

actually it will actually dynamically

change some of the routing options and

steps that are available so if we look

at processes that change dynamically

based on events example of that is this

and I'm going to put all three of them

just so that we have all of them so when

we say that I can change on events there

are couple events that can impact these

changes one of them are data rule events

so we can check our class or we do to

our our budget and as soon as we get to

within a certain percentage of our

budgets that we've spent eighty percent

of budget on a general ledger card then

we can introduce an additional approval

step automatically sir Adam it will

dynamically change based on data rules

they certain business rules that we

might have as well so if you've got a

complex approval matrix it can

dynamically change who the routing will

go to based on their seniority and maybe

the general ledger code that we that

were using for the

for the approval so it doesn't mean that

the workflow will always look the same

it can dynamically change based on a

number of business rules so we have data

rules and business rules and last thing

we have social events or social rules

that can also impact this and so for

example we can change the state when we

get a twitter twitter thing like hash

carjacked help we may escalate that

immediately we can do all sorts of

things with specific events that we can

listen for and and dynamically change

the routing and logic of a process or

even what's what's on the screen when

you talk about context-aware so the

first one was they can they can

dynamically change based on events

secondly these dynamic processes are

context-aware what we mean by that is

what happens if the exchange rate

changes well if the exchange I'd changes

by more than ten percent we will want we

need to we need to introduce an

additional approval step on all purchase

orders from oversee all we need to

automatically introduce a activity that

will always make sure that we buy

forward cover context the way so for

example if there was a storm a massive

storm in a certain area geographical

area we might want to say we need to

change because we're going to have a

huge influx of calls into the insurance

call center we actually want to take a

10-step process and turn it into three

just to get the volumes through quicker

and you can have and you can change the

approval rules based on something like

that so processes are a lot more context

aware for example thing and then lastly

what happens for example also what

happens if the oil price changes it may

have a certain impact now you can you

can listen for those there are web

services and as soon as I need to do a

step I can actually go and look at what

the way the buttons are and these are

just examples of things the context can

also be who's doing the transaction so

for example if it's the the CEO of

organization there's one step in the

approval or yes it always gets approved

or whatever the case might be and so I

can also it's also

we're around who's doing the transaction

and based on that it can it can change

the routing the logic the rules their

approval limits and everything that goes

with it or even what is displayed on the

screen so dynamic process is a lot more

context away and then lastly they've got

built in predictive analytics so you can

have a graph in the approval form and

i'm going to show you example of that

you can add additional steps do that

approval based on the threshold so for

example if i find that I'm within eighty

percent of my budget it can

automatically add another step do that

it can also advise me on what we call

what is the next best action so the

predictive analytics because we don't

have I predefined routing we just have

this container with five or six

activities setting in there we might

want to know well what did the guys

before me do that how Hummer or what is

the what is the happy part what is the

ID percent rule around what the next

step should be for me predictive

analytics the best way that it was

described is that dashboards or rear

view mirrors you can see what happened

in the past with predictive analytics we

actually want to see what is coming and

what is ahead of us so the nice thing is

I can give us in flight analytic so

instead of having a dashboard where we

look back we can see where are we right

now so I'm sitting at my it's like a GPS

the analogy that Janelle hill I've

gotten a used was it's like sitting with

the GPS I can see around me I can see

and I can and I can determine the

context of where I am so I've got

in-flight analytics and it gives me a

nice you can also do real time process

discovery so we can say once again where

are we or we can analyze when I'm in the

activity i can analyze all the previous

instances of that activity and i can say

well what was the what was the next best

action that most people took out of that

so process discovery is just is just

mining the existing process data and we

will publish some

some documents and white papers around

these concepts so lastly before I just

quickly go into the software to show you

is that at Gartner they've also saying

where will be BPM be in 2020 they will

have unstructured processes that will

support dynamic BPM the there will be

social BP it will support social be p.m.

there will be context away it will

support organizational liquidity which

is just a fancy name for change

management but in the end it's all

around intelligent business operation so

let me give you example of what you can

get right now in 2011 you don't have to

wait till 2020 to see some of the stuff

in action you just some screen click and

I'm just really quickly going to log

into XM problem

right so I'm Tim Clark I am the second

person someone else put in a requisition

I'm not going to take you through the

whole workflow in terms of how you are

you put in requisitions but it seems to

someone started a and you tasked to have

a process and in my to-do list under my

cases you will see that I have under

procurement under my under my task list

is a purchase requisition from Keith

that I need to approve when I look at

Keith and this is a simplified example

of typically what this can do but as you

can see we've got a case file we store

all the documents as they come through

as part of the process these are the

dynamic activity so i can add more

activities right now this i can either

just approve it or decline it or i can

send it for technical approval it might

be that we're buying IT i'm not sure why

they're buying new bikes for tour de

france in IT but that doesn't matter so

I'm i just seen it for technical

education and the great thing that you

can see here is that we've actually

embedded analytics or in-flight

analytics so i don't have to go off to

my er be i can see what budget do i have

available how much has actually been

spent how much have we previously

committed to this process and how much

has keith previously requested so you

can build these graphs in you which way

that you want out of external data so

based on this i can now make a decision

on what i want to do looking at this i'm

still not sure what I want to do so i

can say well please advise me on the

next based action so i can see that it

of the lost almost 200 processes that

went through this activity is 145 of

them were actually just approved from

you so this gives me an analysis of what

everyone else before we did and then

gives me an indication if i didn't know

what the next based actually needs now

obviously this is a very simplified

example of this you can also take these

dashboards and go and build right at the

top here and we'll

distance and some examples of that on

our website we you can build your your

process gold dashboard so I can have

three graphs up there showing me my

process goals in terms of where our what

is not what is my monthly budget what

are the actual actual expenditure and

everything to date now this looks like

it's quite complex to do it really isn't

so this is the back end where we design

processes i'm not going to show you how

to design processes what i'm going to

show you is how easy it is to set up a

child so i can choose in that instance

yes this is the one for the budget so

i'm just going to open that and i can

choose the layout that look few colors

and everything that i need for my job

all the terms of properties and whatever

it explains on the screen so the budget

goal the wording everything that you

want to make it easy for people to

understand our processes work so in this

instance you can have your dynamic i'm

sorry you can have your unstructured

processes it's got the building dynamic

and if you look at our social a social

listening webinar you will see that

we've got extensive support for the

social processes so in terms of what

intelligent business operations mean

right now x and pro can give you the

unstructured processes and that makes it

quick to deploy you don't have to that's

highly adaptive it can that the

processes can adapt based on the rules

so if for example i am now at eighty

percent of my budget I can have another

button appear here or I can change that

button to to become executive approval

so i can so i can change dynamically

change the process based on some of

these rules here that is a really

powerful concept for something like

expense control where you would want the

closer you get to this budget line that

the rules change and then lastly we can

we can also introduce discussions and

and the social aspect of

in thank you for watching this I really

appreciate that I'm trying to keep it as

short as possible and show you as much

as we can around the future and why we

believe business process management

moving to intelligent business

operations can be achieved right now

thank you very much
