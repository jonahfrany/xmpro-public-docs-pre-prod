# IoT Platform vs. IoT Business Application Suite | XMPro

https://xmpro.com/iot-platform-vs-business-application-suite/

With the number of connected IoT devices growing exponentially (common estimates are 20-50 billion by 2020, and 500 billion by 2030), one is reminded of the famous quote by Robert Metcalfe:

In network theory, the value of a system grows as approximately the square of the number of users of the system.

Clearly, connecting to these devices and leveraging the information they produce has tremendous potential.  Furthermore, McKinsey estimates that “40 percent of the total value that can be unlocked with the Internet of Things requires different IoT systems to work together.”
There are currently more than 360 “IoT Platforms” in the market1 and the number is continuing to grow (also at a seemingly exponential pace!).  Not every platform is the same, however, and this is a topic we spend considerable time addressing at XMPro.
In its most simple form, an IoT platform is just about enabling connectivity between objects.  In a more sophisticated form, the platform consists of a variety of important building blocks:
Connectivity & normalization; device management; database; processing & action management; analytics; visualization; additional tools; and external interfaces.
Roughly 75% of today‘s IoT platforms focus solely on providing connectivity1.
Looking at this another way, four major technological building blocks of IoT are emerging:
Security is an additional element that is so important it needs to be mentioned as a foundation for each of the above (See Figure 1).
Considering this model, the vast majority of IoT platforms exist independently between the hardware and application layers of the IoT technology stack.
Improvements in productivity and overall operating performance are often the key outcomes sought by industrial organizations exploring or beginning to implement their IIoT (Industrial IoT) strategies and programs.  In these complex, distributed and highly heterogeneous environments, IoT Platforms and internet-based architectures are key to enabling these objectives.  It is the applications that are executed through this architecture, however, which ultimately deliver the business value. 
As highlighted in Figure 2 above, this includes the orchestration of actions performed not only by employees, customers and partners, but also incorporates the information and actions available from the various IT / Line of Business Applications, Manufacturing Systems and Operational Technology, streaming web services, sensors and devices which are already in use today.
So an IoT Business Application Suite is where you build, deploy and maintain the end-to-end applications which actually produce the desired business outcomes.
As an IIoT Business Application Suite, XMPro focuses on the end business application, not the typical IoT Platform plumbing, and brings these benefits:
Both IoT Platforms and IoT Business Application Suites are key pieces of the overall IIoT solution stack.  With the proliferation of companies using similar terms to describe their products and IoT offerings, it is easy to get lost in the technology jargon.  By starting with the business problem you are trying to solve, versus simply comparing technologies, you will quickly discover the solution you really need.
