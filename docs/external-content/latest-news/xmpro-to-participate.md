XMPro to participate as a sponsor at the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo, Gold Coast, 14 – 17 November, 2011.
North Sydney, NSW, Australia – 16th September 2011. XMPro Pty Ltd is proud to announce their participation as a sponsor at the Gartner Symposium / ITxpo, Gold Coast, 14 – 17 November 2011.
Gartner analysts and technology solution providers will gather at the Gold Coast Convention Centre to address hot topics including mobile, social, cloud and context-aware computing.
Two mastermind keynotes from industry leaders have been announced:
“The rise of new technologies has given IT a seat at the strategy table — offering a new context for an organisation’s infrastructure, investment, innovation and growth,” said John Roberts, vice president, distinguished analyst and conference chair for Symposium/ITxpo. “As a CIO and senior IT leader, your success depends on embracing new technologies — and knowing how to broaden the impact of IT’s contribution to cost management, operational excellence, enterprise growth and competitive advantage.”
Pieter van Schalkwyk, Managing Director of XMPro, comments on the XMPro’s participation at the Symposium “80% of process work is unstructured, according to Gartner’s Janelle Hill. In only 20% of cases can you create a predefined workflow diagram with any level of certainty. That means traditional Workflow technology doesn’t solve the dynamic work habits of the new workforce that you as the CIO need to enable. See how XMPro goes “DynaMocial” on the Gold Coast. See how we enable the Dynamic, Mobile and Socially enabled workforce that gives better control to IT, a better experience to end users and better outcomes for business.”
With more than 200 sessions, industry defining keynotes and a vast array of technology solutions on-site, many CIOs attend with their leadership team – an ideal way to generate meaningful, in-depth discussion about your business’s key priorities and reap benefits of a unified approach.
Join XMPro and Gartner at the Gold Coast to experience the power of in-depth IT analysis, collaborative problem-solving and industry thought leadership at its best.
