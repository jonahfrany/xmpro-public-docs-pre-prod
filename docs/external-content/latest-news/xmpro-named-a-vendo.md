Dallas, TX, September 15, 2019 – XMPro is excited to share that it has been listed as a “Vendor to Watch” in the recently published Gartner Market Trends: Software Providers Ramp Up to Serve the Emerging Digital Twin Market report.
According to Gartner, “Enterprises are increasingly developing and building digital twins to meet targeted business outcomes, ranging from maintenance optimization to process analysis to customer engagement. Gartner’s 2019 CIO Survey indicates that 6% of enterprises have already deployed digital twins, and another 38% are engaged in one- to three-year planning stages to deploy digital twins.”
“We are excited to be recognized by Gartner as a vendor to watch in this space, especially because digital twin adoption is predicted to increase dramatically in the coming years. Our customers are already seeing the results of deploying digital twins in real industrial environments,” said Pieter van Schalkwyk, CEO of XMPro. “We believe this recognition validates our unique approach to creating digital twins, as we focus on integrating real-time IoT data with business processes.”
