## Start Small, Scale Fast With Flexible Subscription Pricing

At XMPro, we understand that each business has unique needs and challenges. That’s why we offer flexible software subscriptions and services packages designed to suit your unique situation.

## Pricing Models

## Consumption

The Consumption Pricing Model in XMPro is designed with flexibility in mind, incorporating a fixed minimum monthly charge alongside a variable rate that adjusts based on the volume of message ingestion, calculated per million messages. This model is particularly suited for scenarios with low message frequency, offering an economical solution for businesses managing variable data loads. Additionally, connectors are billed on a monthly basis, ensuring that costs are predictable and aligned with usage, making this model an attractive option for companies seeking both scalability and cost-efficiency.

## Enterprise

The Enterprise Pricing Model at XMPro offers a fixed annual subscription, tailored to the scale and scope of your business, whether it’s a Business Unit, an entire Enterprise, or a Corporate entity. This model provides a straightforward and predictable cost structure, ideal for budgetary planning. With annual charges for connectors, this preferred model simplifies financial planning by offering a stable, fixed cost that can be easily anticipated and managed, ensuring seamless integration and operation throughout the subscription period.

## Per Asset

The Per Asset Pricing Model is tailored for specific asset classes that are clearly defined and quantifiable. Pricing under this model is determined based on the volume and the inherent value of the assets, allowing for a flexible approach that can adapt to the unique needs of your operations. Connector fees are applied on a monthly basis, ensuring that costs are aligned with your usage and offering a transparent pricing structure that facilitates easy budgeting and financial planning.

## PILOT PROJECT TRIAL

The XMPro Pilot Program is an in-depth evaluation system that assists businesses in implementing XMPro’s suite with unlimited data streams, users, and connectors for integration. The program is structured into three phases: Design & Configure, Run Pilot, and Review, spanning an anticipated duration of 14-18 weeks. The Design phase involves creating dashboards and recommendations, followed by building and scaling in the second phase, and finally deploying the solution. During the Run phase, the pilot is tested and refined, with regular reviews to ensure alignment with business objectives. The Review phase focuses on evaluating the pilot’s outcomes against baseline metrics and planning for full production deployment.

The Pilot Program is priced at $3,000 per month for the software, with additional hosting packages available on XMPro’s cloud or dedicated Azure instances, ensuring a comprehensive and tailored evaluation experience.

$3,000/month*

*Hosting & Service rates charged seperately.

*XMPro Pilot software package is available for a maximum of 6 months. The pricing is for unlimited data streams, unlimited number of users, and unlimited connectors on desktop and mobile applications. The software pricing commences with the commencement of Phase 1 / Sprint 2 – Build and Scale.

The advantage of this approach is that the organization can verify the selected Use Case(s) with XMPro and provide confirmation of the number of data streams and details of the connectors.

XMPro standard pricing will apply after the pilot/MVP period based on XMPro’s pricelist.
