We are pleased to announce that XMPro, as the offical Regional Branch Organiser for the Digital Twin Consortium® (DTC) across Australia and New Zealand, will host its first in-person event in Perth on 24 August 2022. 
The Perth DTC event will focus specifically on the value of digital twins in natural resource industries. 
We’re bringing together industry experts, market leaders and key stakeholders to share how digital twin technology is solving challenges for organisations in mining, oil and gas, energy and utilities.
“From tracking sustainability goals, to simulating severe operating conditions and improving maintenance practices with real-time visibility into asset health, digital twins have far-reaching benefits for organisations in natural resources,” commented Pieter van Schalkwyk, XMPro CEO and co-chair of the DTC Natural Resources Working Group. “We’re looking forward to bringing together a diverse group of practitioners and thought leaders in the Perth community to start interesting discussions and build momentum on the topic of digital twins in WA.”
