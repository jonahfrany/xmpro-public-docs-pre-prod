# XMPro Agent Integration Update: JSON Connector - XMPRO

URL: https://xmpro.com/new-xmpro-agent-integration-json-connector/

XMPro is expanding our library of out-of-the-box integrations for enterprise applications, data platforms, machine learning tools, and operational systems. These pre-built integrations allow our customers to build integrated composable digital twins that are not only scalable but highly customizable for their specific use cases.
We are pleased to announce updated capability in our JSON Connector Agent.
JSON Connector Agent
The JSON Connector uses the JSON text string you provide to simulate data input for an XMPro Application.
This is useful when you are developing an XMPro Application before live data is available, or as a simulated data source for demos.
Details for an example and its configuration can be found in the How to Use section here.
