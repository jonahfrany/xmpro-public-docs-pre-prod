Dallas, TX, April 9, 2015 — XMPro, a leading provider of Intelligent Business Operations software was named one of the “20 Most Promising BPM Solution Providers 2015” by CIO Review.
Of the recognition, XMPro’s CEO Pieter van Schalkwyk said, “We are honored to be recognized by CIO Review as one of the top 20 companies at the forefront of providing Business Process Management solutions.
XMPro’s BPM module covers the entire scope of work, from structured to more dynamic to completely agile processes.
More importantly, it doesn’t only rely on the BPM component, but combines it with Operational Intelligence. This is our ability to sense key business events, decide if an action is needed and then take the appropriate action.
We find that customers don’t want to buy 2 separate products. They don’t want to buy a workflow tool and a case tool. They want their work management all to happen in one place. We refer to this as Sense > Decide > Act and it is an end-to-end solution to the problems that our customers want to resolve.”
The top players in the competitive BPM field were selected for this annual list by a distinguished panel of CEOs, CIOs, CMOs, analysts, and the CIO Review editorial board. For the complete magazine issue and to see the full list go to http://magazine.cioreview.com/March-2015/BPM/
