We are excited to announce that the Azure Data Factory agent is the latest integration to join our catalogue.
Azure Data Factory is Azure’s cloud ETL service for scalable serverless data integration and data transformation. It offers a code-free UI for intuitive authoring and single-pane-of-glass monitoring and management. You can also lift and shift existing SSIS packages to Azure and run them with full compatibility in ADF. SSIS Integration Runtime offers a fully managed service, so you don’t have to worry about infrastructure management.
The Azure Data Factory Action Agent allows you to manually trigger an Azure Data Factory Pipeline run for an existing pipeline.
For more information on Azure Data Factory, please see its website or read our documentation.
At XMPro, we are continually adding to our library of integrations for enterprise applications, data platforms, AI learning tools, and operational systems. These pre-built Agents enable our clients to effectively extract meaning from different information sources by carrying out specific functions in their data streams.
