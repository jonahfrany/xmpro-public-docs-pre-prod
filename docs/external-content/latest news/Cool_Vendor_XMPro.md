Dallas, TX, 16th January 2013 – XMPro, named Gartner Cool Vendor for Business Process Management 2012 , today announced their participation as a sponsor at the Gartner Business Process Management (BPM) Summit, to be held this year in London from 13 – 14 March 2013.
The Gartner Business Process Management Summit is designed specifically for business and IT leaders tasked with making business processes smarter, more agile and better able to respond to constantly changing business dynamics.
This Gartner BPM summit is the most comprehensive BPM conference in Europe, offering forward-thinking, trusted independent advice and actionable recommendations for driving real business transformation.
Key agenda highlights include:
Steve Howcroft, XMPro Director, commented “If your business strategy is to reduce process cost, maintain control, work anywhere (even in the cloud) and stay competitive while promoting social process collaboration, and content sharing – XMPro, with its unstructured event based approach, offers you the must have solution. This event in London provides us with the ideal opportunity to showcase our solution to the right decision makers.”
“We have significantly enlarged our footprint in the US in the last year and appreciate this opportunity to focus on the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. 80% of WORK done in businesses today cannot be structured as predefined workflows. If not managed, unstructured work reduces productivity and profitability; it impacts customer satisfaction negatively and increases risk,” said Pieter van Schalkwyk, CEO of XMPro. “XMPro enables companies to achieve their strategic work goals, rather than to restrict them to a work flow.”
Join XMPro at the Gartner event [C2] in London to make your business processes smarter, more agile and better able to respond to constantly changing business dynamics.
