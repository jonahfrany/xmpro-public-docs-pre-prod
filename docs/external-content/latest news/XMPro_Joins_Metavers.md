Dallas, TX, July 14, 2022 – XMPro, a No-Code Application Development Platform provider for asset-intensive industries, today announced it has joined the Metaverse Standards Forum (MSF).
The Metaverse Standards Forum provides a venue for cooperation between standards organizations and companies to foster the development of interoperability standards for an open and inclusive metaverse, and accelerate their development and deployment through pragmatic, action-based projects.
“We’re excited to join the Metaverse Standards Forum and contribute to their initiatives to improve interoperability in the metaverse. As a key contributing member to industry bodies like the Digital Twin Consortium, XMPro will be able to deliver unique insights into how digital twins can interact with other technologies within the metaverse,” commented Pieter van Schalkwyk, XMPro CEO.
“We look forward to playing our part in building a pervasive, open, and inclusive metaverse by sharing the lessons we’ve learned from implementing real-time applications in heterogeneous technology environments.”
The Forum will focus on pragmatic, action-based projects such as implementation prototyping, hackathons, plugfests, and open-source tooling to accelerate the testing and adoption of standards, while also developing consistent terminology and deployment guidelines.
The Forum will not create standards itself but will coordinate requirements and resources to foster the creation and evolution of standards within standards organizations working in relevant domains.
